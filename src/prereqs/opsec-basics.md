# Operational Security

## The Absolute Basics

### Password Managers
If there's one foundational recommendation for operational security, it's to use a password manager. Consider it not just a tool for passwords but a secure vault for notes, important addresses, and business information.

With a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com), you should create strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. There is no need to remember them, as the app fills out login forms for you.

Data breaches are frequent, often leading to leaked passwords. Notable figures, [including Donald Trump, have faced hacking incidents](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/87/) due to using passwords exposed in breaches and reused elsewhere. By adopting strong, unique passwords, you can avoid such pitfalls.

### Signal
Our cellular infrastructure is broken. Look up "[SS7 Vulnerability](https://duckduckgo.com/?va=n&t=hs&q=ss7+vulnerability&ia=web)." Never rely on traditional cellular networks for transmitting confidential information.

Enter [Signal](https://signal.org). Widely recognized as one of the most secure private messengers available, it's the only one we'll recommend here. Journalists, governments, and military organizations worldwide trust it.

It's free, open-source, backed by a non-profit, and stands out as a leader in the secure messaging landscape.

### Tor and VPNs
Both Tor and VPNs offer online anonymity by hiding your IP address. 

Think back to your preschool days when you wanted to send a secret "I <3 U" note to a crush. You asked your bestie to deliver it, ensuring your crush remained clueless about the admirer. In this analogy, your friend acts as the VPN. Though the message reaches its destination, there's someone in between who knows the secret.

Tor is like thousands of random people willing to pass the message for you, but they don't know who you are or its contents. And instead of it going from you to your bestie to your crush, it goes from you to three random volunteers worldwide, who you don't know but will deliver the message.

While VPNs are suitable for daily use or public networks, turn to Tor when facing high stakes or advanced threats. Edward Snowden trusted Tor and the [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) operating system when leaking classified documents. It worked.

However, always research VPNs thoroughly. Some may falsely claim not to log data.

### Two-Factor Authentication
Activate two-factor authentication on all accounts that support it. It necessitates an additional code alongside your password for logins. This code is typically delivered via text message, email, or generated by an app like Google Authenticator.

By implementing this, even if someone knows your password, they'd still need access to your secondary authentication method.

### Email
Standard email services, akin to SMS, aren't ideal for sensitive information. End-to-end encryption isn't ubiquitous, and giants like Google often process your data for ad-targeting.

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) emerges as a strong alternative. Like Signal, ProtonMail seamlessly integrates encryption, freeing users from its intricacies. For full encryption benefits, both the sender and recipient should use ProtonMail. Regardless, they prioritize user privacy, steering clear of monetizing your data.

## Conclusion
These steps represent the foundational blocks of operational security. Always stay updated on the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats and continually seek ways to bolster your opsec.
