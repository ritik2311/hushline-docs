1. **Send a Message:** Use the contact form in the app to reach out to us. Include your name or organization's name and a preferred method of contact (email or phone number). We'll get back to you to schedule a verification meeting.
2. **Prepare Your Documents:** To verify your identity or your authority to represent an organization, please include the relevant documents for your role:
   - **A Valid ID:** Government-issued identification that shows your full name and photo.
   - **Proof of Employment or Association:** A letter from your employer or organization confirming your role or a recent pay stub.

   - **Proof of Authority:** For those representing organizations, a document proving your authority to represent the organization, such as a power of attorney or a board resolution.

   These documents help us ensure that verified accounts are granted to the rightful individuals or representatives of organizations.

## Safeguards

To help guard against abuse, our verification system is built so that if a verified user changes their username or display name, they'll lose their verified status and need to initiate the process again. This feature is intended to eliminate the risk of a user with a verified account changing their information to impersonate another person or organization.
