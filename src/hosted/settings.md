# Settings

## Profile Settings

Users can tailor Hush Line to their needs, from adding a display name to adding multiple usernames.

### Display Name

Users can set a human-readable display name so that someone submitting a message can see "Submit a message to Science & Design" rather than "Submit a message to scidsg".

#### Verification

As a security measure, if a user changes their display name after verification, they'll lose that status and must re-verify their account.

## Authentication

### Two-Factor Authentication

To improve account security, users can enable two-factor authentication, making account compromises, even in the event of a password leak, impossible.

### Change Password

Users can change their password when needed.

### Change Username

Changing your username is easy but can lead to confusion for end-users, especially for well-known organizations.

#### Verification

Like when changing your display name, when you change your username, you'll lose verification and need to go through the process again.

## Email & PGP

### Email Delivery

Users can have messages delivered to an email address and with the SMTP service of their choosing.

### PGP

Users can opt to have their messages encrypted so they're only readable by them. This is a highly encouraged option, especially for journalists.

## Advanced
