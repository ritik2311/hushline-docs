# Introduction to Hush Line

<img src="../img/hosted-hushline.png">

This document outlines the core components of a robust Flask web application designed for secure communication and user management. Built with Python, this application leverages Flask, a lightweight and powerful web framework, to create a user-friendly interface and backend logic. The application's features are diverse, including user authentication, secure message handling, PGP encryption for privacy, SMTP integration for email communication, and two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.

At its heart, the application centers around user interactions, allowing for account creation, login, and settings customization. Users can securely manage their profiles, including changing usernames, passwords, and setting up email configurations. The integration of PGP keys adds a layer of encryption to user communications, ensuring that messages remain confidential and secure. Additionally, the application includes functionality for sending emails directly from the user's account, which is essential for notifications and communications within the app.

## 1. Importing Libraries and Frameworks

This section is all about importing various tools and libraries that Hush Line needs to work properly. Think of it as gathering all the ingredients before starting to cook a meal. Here’s a breakdown:
    
1. Standard Library Imports: These are basic tools provided by Python.

- `os`: Helps with interacting with the computer's operating system.

- `io`: Used for handling different types of input and output.

- `base64`: A method for encoding data.

- `logging`: A way to keep track of what happens when the app runs.

- `re`: Helps in working with text using patterns (called regular expressions).

- `RotatingFileHandler from logging.handlers`: Manages log files, like creating new files when the old one gets too big.

- `datetime`: Deals with dates and times.

- `smtplib`: Sends emails from Hush Line.

- `MIMEText and MIMEMultipart from email.mime`: Used to create emails with text and other parts like attachments.


2. Flask Framework and Extensions: Flask is like a foundation for building web applications.

- `Flask`: The core of the web app.

- `request, render_template, redirect, url_for, session, flash`: These are tools for handling web pages, user requests, and showing messages.

- `SQLAlchemy`: Manages a database through Python code.

- `Bcrypt`: A security tool for hashing passwords.

- `FlaskForm`: Used for creating forms in the web app.

- `generate_password_hash, check_password_hash`: They make and check secure passwords.


3. Form Handling and Validation: This is about dealing with forms (like login or sign-up) and making sure the data is correct.

- `TextAreaField, StringField, PasswordField, IntegerField`: Types of fields in a form.

- `DataRequired, Length, Email, ValidationError`: Rules to make sure the form data is valid.


4. Cryptography and Security: These are for keeping data safe.

- `pyotp`: Generates one-time passwords for two-factor authentication.

- `gnupg`: Deals with encryption and decryption using GPG (GNU Privacy Guard).

- `Fernet from cryptography.fernet`: Encrypts and decrypts data.

5. Database and Error Handling:

- `IntegrityError from sqlalchemy.exc`: Catches errors related to the database.

6. Environment Variables:

- `load_dotenv`: Loads environment variables, which are like private settings for Hush Line.

7. QR Code Generation:

- `qrcode`: Creates QR codes, which are like barcodes that can be scanned with a smartphone.

8. Utility Decorators:

- `wraps from functools`: Helps in making custom decorators (decorators are like special labels in Python that can add extra features to functions).


Each of these imports plays a specific role in Hush Line, from handling user interactions to ensuring security and dealing with data. They're like the different parts of a toolkit, each with its own purpose.

### Code Snippet

```

## 2. Environment Setup and Configuration

This part of the code is like setting up the backstage before the main show. It involves getting some important secret information ready for Hush Line. Let's break it down:
    
1. Load Environment Variables:

- `load_dotenv()`: This line is like telling Hush Line, "Hey, before you start, make sure to read the secret notes I left for you." These notes are the environment variables stored in a file (typically named .env). This file is not shared publicly, keeping sensitive information like passwords safe.

2. Retrieve Database Credentials and Secret Key:

- `db_user, db_pass, db_name, secret_key`: These lines are like picking up specific notes from the secret file. They get the username, password, and name for the database, plus a secret key. This secret key is super important for Hush Line's security, especially for things like keeping user sessions safe.

3. Load Encryption Key:

- `encryption_key = os.getenv("ENCRYPTION_KEY")`: This is like getting another secret note, but this one is for encrypting (or scrambling) data so that only Hush Line can understand it.

- `if encryption_key is None`: Here, the code checks if the encryption key was actually found in the notes. If not, it's like saying, "Hey, something's wrong. I can't find the key!" and then it stops with an error message.

- `fernet = Fernet(encryption_key)`: If the key is found, this part is like creating a special lock (Fernet) using that key. This lock will be used to scramble and unscramble data in Hush Line.

In simple terms, these steps are about making sure Hush Line knows where to find the database and how to keep things safe and private. It's like setting up a secure, private space where Hush Line can safely store and handle important information.

### Code Snippet

```
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Retrieve database credentials and secret key from environment
db_user = os.getenv("DB_USER")
db_pass = os.getenv("DB_PASS")
db_name = os.getenv("DB_NAME")
secret_key = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")

# Load encryption key
encryption_key = os.getenv("ENCRYPTION_KEY")
if encryption_key is None:
    raise ValueError("Encryption key not found. Please check your .env file.")
fernet = Fernet(encryption_key)
```

## 3. Encryption and Decryption Functions

These two functions, `encrypt_field` and `decrypt_field`, are like secret agents in Hush Line. They work with the special lock (Fernet) set up earlier to keep user's data safe.

1. `encrypt_field` Function:

- What it does: It takes some data (like a message or password) and scrambles it into a secret code.

- How it works:

  - First, it checks if the data is empty (`None`). If it is, it just returns `None` because there's nothing to scramble.

  - If there's data, it uses the `fernet.encrypt` method. Think of this like putting the data into a secret code machine.

  - The `data.encode()` part converts the data into a format (bytes) that the secret code machine understands.

  - After the data is scrambled, decode() changes it back into a normal text format, but now it's in a secret code!

2. `decrypt_field` Function:

- What it does: It takes scrambled data (the secret code) and turns it back into its original form.

- How it works:

  - It also checks if the data is empty first. If yes, it returns `None`.

  - If there's scrambled data, it uses the `fernet.decrypt` method. This is like putting the secret code back into the machine to turn it back into the original message.

  - The `data.encode()` part is again converting the scrambled text into a format (bytes) that the machine can work with.

  - After decrypting, `decode()` is used to convert it back from bytes to normal text.

In simple terms, these two functions are like a magic show in Hush Line. One function (encrypt_field) takes a regular message and turns it into a secret code. The other function (decrypt_field) takes the secret code and turns it back into the original message. This magic trick is very important to keep information safe and private in Hush Line.

### Code Snippet

```
def encrypt_field(data):
    if data is None:
        return None
    return fernet.encrypt(data.encode()).decode()


def decrypt_field(data):
    if data is None:
        return None
    return fernet.decrypt(data.encode()).decode()
```

## 4. Creating and Configuring the Flask Application

This part of the code is where the Flask web application is created and set up with various configurations. It's like laying down the foundation and rules for how the web app will behave.

1. Creating the Flask Application:

- `app = Flask(__name__)`: This line is like saying, "Let's start building our web app." It creates a new Flask application. The `__name__` part helps Flask know where to look for resources like templates and static files.

2. Configuring the Secret Key:

- `app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = secret_key`: This sets a secret key for Hush Line, which is used for keeping client-side sessions secure.

3. Database Configuration:

- `app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"]`: This line tells Hush Line where to find the database. It's like giving an address to the app so it knows where to store and retrieve data. The format `mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/dbname` includes the type of database (`mysql`), the way to connect to it (`pymysql`), the username and password, and the database name.

4. Turning off SQLAlchemy Modifications Tracking:

- app.config["SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS"] = False: This disables a feature in SQLAlchemy that tracks modifications of objects and emits signals. It's turned off to save memory and prevent extra overhead.

5. Secure Cookies Configuration:

- `app.config["SESSION_COOKIE_NAME"] = "__Host-session"`: Sets the name for the session cookie.

- `app.config["SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE"] = True`: Ensures that cookies are only sent over HTTPS, which is a more secure way of sending data over the internet.

- `app.config["SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY"] = True`: This makes sure that JavaScript cannot access the session cookie, adding an extra layer of security against certain types of attacks.

- `app.config["SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE"] = "Lax"`: This controls how cookies are sent with requests from other sites. "Lax" allows some cross-site requests, balancing security and usability.

In summary, this section is about building the foundation of the web app with Flask, telling it where to find its database, and setting up important security measures like how to handle secret keys and cookies.

### Code Snippet

```
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = secret_key
app.config[
    "SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"
] = f"mysql+pymysql://{db_user}:{db_pass}@localhost/{db_name}"
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS"] = False

# Session configuration for secure cookies
app.config["SESSION_COOKIE_NAME"] = "__Host-session"
app.config["SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE"] = True  # Only send cookies over HTTPS
app.config[
    "SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY"
] = True  # Prevent JavaScript access to session cookie
app.config[
    "SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE"
] = "Lax"  # Control cookie sending with cross-site requests
```

## 5. Initializing Security Tools and Extensions

This section of the code is about setting up additional tools and extensions that add specific functionalities to Hush Line.

1. Initializing GPG for Encryption:

- `gpg_home = os.path.expanduser("~/.gnupg")`: Here, the code is setting up a location on the computer to store GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) related files. GPG is used for encryption and digital signatures. The `expanduser` function is used to find the `.gnupg` directory in the home folder of the current user.

- `gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome=gpg_home)`: This line creates a new GPG object with the specified home directory. It's like telling Hush Line, "Here's the toolkit for encryption and decryption, and it's stored in this specific place."

2. Initializing Flask Extensions:

- `bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)`: Bcrypt is an extension for Flask to handle password hashing. This line is like adding a special tool to Hush Line that can take plain passwords and turn them into a secure format, making it safer.

- `db = SQLAlchemy(app)`: Here, SQLAlchemy, an extension for handling databases, is being initialized with Hush Line. This is like attaching a powerful tool to Hush Line that can manage and talk to the database easily. SQLAlchemy lets you interact with the database using Python code instead of writing SQL queries.

In summary, this part of the code is about equipping Hush Line with important tools for security (GPG) and functionality (bcrypt for password security and SQLAlchemy for database management). It's like adding specialized equipment to Hush Line's toolkit, each serving a specific purpose to enhance the app's capabilities.

### Code Snippet

```
# Initialize GPG with expanded home directory
gpg_home = os.path.expanduser("~/.gnupg")
gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome=gpg_home)

# Initialize extensions
bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

## 6. Setting Up Log File Management

This section of the code deals with setting up a system to manage log files for Hush Line. Log files are like a diary for Hush Line, recording what it does, when it does it, and if anything unusual happens. Here's what each part does:
    

1. Creating a Rotating File Handler:

- `file_handler = RotatingFileHandler("flask.log", maxBytes=1024 * 1024 * 100, backupCount=20)`: This creates a log file handler that writes logs to a file named `flask.log`. The 'rotating' part means that when the log file reaches a certain size (100 MB, in this case), it starts a new file, so the logs don't get too big and hard to manage. It keeps up to 20 of these files as backups.

2. Configuring the File Handler:

- `file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`: This sets the level of logs to capture. DEBUG level means it will record even the most detailed messages, which is helpful for understanding exactly what's happening in Hush Line, especially when troubleshooting.

- `file_handler.setFormatter(...)`: This part defines how each log entry should look. It includes the time (`asctime`), the severity level of the log (levelname), the actual message (`message`), and where in the code the log was recorded (`pathname` and `lineno`).

3. Adding the File Handler to the Flask Logger:

- `app.logger.addHandler(file_handler)`: This attaches the file handler you just set up to Hush Line's logger. Now, whenever something log-worthy happens in Hush Line, it will be written to the `flask.log` file in the format you specified.

- `app.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`: This ensures that the Flask app's logger is also capturing debug-level messages.

In simple terms, this part of the code is about keeping a detailed and organized record of what Hush Line does and how it behaves. It's like setting up a surveillance camera inside Hush Line to keep an eye on things and report back, which is incredibly valuable for maintaining and debugging the app.

### Code Snippet

```
# Setup file handler
file_handler = RotatingFileHandler(
    "flask.log", maxBytes=1024 * 1024 * 100, backupCount=20
)
file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
file_handler.setFormatter(
    logging.Formatter(
        "%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s [in %(pathname)s:%(lineno)d]"
    )
)

# Add it to the Flask logger
app.logger.addHandler(file_handler)
app.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## 7. Implementing a Custom Password Policy

This section of the code defines a custom password policy to ensure that users create strong and secure passwords. It's like setting rules for a secret club's password – it needs to be tough to guess!

1. Creating the ComplexPassword Class:

- `class ComplexPassword(object)`: This line starts the definition of a new class, named `ComplexPassword`. A class in programming is like a blueprint for creating something; in this case, it's for checking password complexity.

- `def __init__(self, message=None)`: This is the initializer of the class, where you set up its basic properties. The `message` parameter can be used to provide a custom error message, but if none is provided, it defaults to a standard message saying the password must include uppercase, lowercase, digits, and a special character.

2. Defining the Password Validation Rule:

- `def __call__(self, form, field)`: This special method makes the `ComplexPassword` class work like a function. When you use this class, this method is what actually runs.

- Inside this method, the password (`password = field.data`) is checked against several conditions using regular expressions (re.search). These conditions are:

  - Must contain at least one uppercase letter (`[A-Z]`).

  - Must contain at least one lowercase letter (`[a-z]`).

  - Must contain at least one digit (`[0-9]`).

  - Must contain at least one special character (anything that's not a letter or digit).

- If the password doesn't meet these conditions, a `ValidationError` with the specified message is raised. This stops the process and alerts the user to the problem with their password.

In summary, this code ensures that whenever a user chooses a password, it must be complex enough to meet certain security standards. This is a key part of keeping user accounts secure, as stronger passwords are harder for others to guess or crack.

### Code Snippet

```
# Password Policy
class ComplexPassword(object):
    def __init__(self, message=None):
        if not message:
            message = "⛔️ Password must include uppercase, lowercase, digit, and a special character."
        self.message = message

    def __call__(self, form, field):
        password = field.data
        if not (
            re.search("[A-Z]", password)
            and re.search("[a-z]", password)
            and re.search("[0-9]", password)
            and re.search("[^A-Za-z0-9]", password)
        ):
            raise ValidationError(self.message)
```

## 8. Defining the User Database Model

This section sets up a blueprint for user data in the database. It's like creating a detailed form for what information should be stored about each user.

1. Creating the User Class:

- `class User(db.Model)`: This line defines a new class called `User`, which represents a user in the database. The `db.Model` part indicates that this class is a special SQLAlchemy model, which means it's directly linked to a table in the database.

2. Defining User Attributes:

- Each `db.Column` defines a field in the user table:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each user. It's the primary key, which means it's the main way to identify a different row (or user) in the database.

- `username`: The user's chosen name. It's unique, so no two users can have the same username.

- `display_name`: An optional name the user can display.

- `_password_hash`, `_totp_secret`, `_email`, `_smtp_server`, `_smtp_username`, `_smtp_password`, `_pgp_key`: These fields store sensitive information and are prefixed with an underscore, indicating they are intended to be private.

- `is_verified`: A boolean field that indicates whether the user's account is verified.

3. Encryption and Decryption for Sensitive Fields:

- The `@property` and corresponding setter methods for fields like `password_hash`, `totp_secret`, `email`, etc., are used for encrypting and decrypting data.

- When you set a value, like a password, the setter method (`password_hash.setter`) encrypts the value before storing it in the database.

- When you access a value, the corresponding property (like password_hash) decrypts the data, so it's readable.

4. Handling of Optional Fields:

- For fields like `totp_secret` and `pgp_key`, the setter method includes a condition to handle `None` values, meaning these fields are optional and can be left blank.

In summary, this class is a complete package for managing user data. It includes not only what data is stored but also how to handle sensitive information securely. When a new user is added to Hush Line, a new instance of this class is created, and the user's details are stored according to this structure.

### Code Snippet

```
# Database Models
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    display_name = db.Column(db.String(80))
    _password_hash = db.Column("password_hash", db.String(255))
    _totp_secret = db.Column("totp_secret", db.String(255))
    _email = db.Column("email", db.String(255))
    _smtp_server = db.Column("smtp_server", db.String(255))
    smtp_port = db.Column("smtp_port", db.Integer)
    _smtp_username = db.Column("smtp_username", db.String(255))
    _smtp_password = db.Column("smtp_password", db.String(255))
    _pgp_key = db.Column("pgp_key", db.Text)
    is_verified = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)

    @property
    def password_hash(self):
        return decrypt_field(self._password_hash)

    @password_hash.setter
    def password_hash(self, value):
        self._password_hash = encrypt_field(value)

    @property
    def totp_secret(self):
        return decrypt_field(self._totp_secret)

    @totp_secret.setter
    def totp_secret(self, value):
        if value is None:
            self._totp_secret = None
        else:
            self._totp_secret = encrypt_field(value)

    @property
    def email(self):
        return decrypt_field(self._email)

    @email.setter
    def email(self, value):
        self._email = encrypt_field(value)

    @property
    def smtp_server(self):
        return decrypt_field(self._smtp_server)

    @smtp_server.setter
    def smtp_server(self, value):
        self._smtp_server = encrypt_field(value)

    @property
    def smtp_username(self):
        return decrypt_field(self._smtp_username)

    @smtp_username.setter
    def smtp_username(self, value):
        self._smtp_username = encrypt_field(value)

    @property
    def smtp_password(self):
        return decrypt_field(self._smtp_password)

    @smtp_password.setter
    def smtp_password(self, value):
        self._smtp_password = encrypt_field(value)

    @property
    def pgp_key(self):
        return decrypt_field(self._pgp_key)

    @pgp_key.setter
    def pgp_key(self, value):
        if value is None:
            self._pgp_key = None
        else:
            self._pgp_key = encrypt_field(value)
```

## 9. Defining the Message Database Model

This part of the code sets up the structure for storing messages in the database. It's like creating a special box to keep each message safe and linked to the user who sent or received it.

1. Creating the Message Class:

- `class Message(db.Model)`: This line defines a new class called `Message`. As with the `User` class, `db.Model` shows that it's a model linked to a database table.

2. Defining Message Attributes:

- `id`: Like in the `User` class, this is a unique identifier for each message and serves as the primary key.

- `_content`: This field holds the message content. It's stored as encrypted text (indicated by the underscore prefix), meaning it will be scrambled to keep it private.

- `user_id`: This field creates a link between each message and a user. It's a foreign key pointing to the `id` field in the user table, indicating which user the message belongs to.

3. Establishing Relationship with the User Model:

- `user = db.relationship(...)`: This line creates a relationship between each message and its user. It means that each message is connected to a specific user. The `backref` is like a backdoor from the user to their messages, allowing you to access all messages from a user. The `cascade` option ensures that if a user is deleted, their messages will be deleted too (like cleaning up a user's mailbox when they leave).

4. Handling Encrypted Message Content:

- `@property` and `@content.setter`: These are used for decrypting and encrypting the message content, similar to how the `User` class handles sensitive fields. When you set the `content` of a message, it's encrypted before being stored. When you access it, it's decrypted so you can read the actual message.

5. Temporary Attribute for Template Rendering:

- `is_encrypted = False`: This is a temporary attribute used during template rendering. It's not stored in the database but can be used in the Flask templates to indicate whether a message is encrypted.

In summary, the `Message` class defines how to store messages, ensuring they are kept private and securely linked to the users who own them. Each message is carefully wrapped in this structure whenever it's saved or retrieved from the database.

### Code Snippet

```
class Message(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    _content = db.Column(
        "content", db.Text, nullable=False
    )  # Encrypted content stored here
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("user.id"), nullable=False)

    # Relationship with User model updated to include cascade deletion
    user = db.relationship(
        "User", backref=db.backref("messages", lazy=True, cascade="all, delete-orphan")
    )

    # Temporary attribute for template rendering
    is_encrypted = False

    @property
    def content(self):
        """Decrypt and return the message content."""
        return decrypt_field(self._content)

    @content.setter
    def content(self, value):
        """Encrypt and store the message content."""
        self._content = encrypt_field(value)
```

## 10. Defining the InviteCode Database Model

This section of the code describes how to handle invite codes in Hush Line's database. Invite codes can be thought of as special tickets, each with a unique code, which users need to join or access certain features of Hush Line.

1. Creating the InviteCode Class:

- `class InviteCode(db.Model)`: This defines a new class, `InviteCode`, which is a model linked to a database table.

2. Defining InviteCode Attributes:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each invite code, acting as the primary key in the database.

- `code`: The actual invite code. It's set to be unique, so no two invite codes are the same.

- `expiration_date`: This field stores when the invite code expires. It uses the DateTime type, which includes both the date and time.

- `used`: A boolean field indicating whether the invite code has been used. By default, it's set to False, meaning the code is unused when it's first created.

3. Representing Invite Codes:

- `def __repr__(self)`: This method is a special function in Python classes. It's used to define how an instance of this class should be represented as a string. In this case, whenever you print an invite code or otherwise convert it to a string, it will display as `<InviteCode [code]>`, where `[code]` is replaced by the actual invite code.

In summary, the `InviteCode` class is like creating a structure for VIP passes. Each pass has a unique number, an expiration date, and a marker to show if it's been used. This structure is used every time a new invite code is generated or checked in Hush Line.

### Code Snippet

```
class InviteCode(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    code = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)
    expiration_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
    used = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return "<InviteCode %r>" % self.code
```

## 11. Creating the MessageForm for User Input

This part of the code is about making a form for users to send messages. It's like creating a simple online form where users can type and submit their messages.

1. Defining the MessageForm Class:

- `class MessageForm(FlaskForm)`: This line starts the definition of a new class named `MessageForm`. It inherits from `FlaskForm`, which means it's a special kind of form used in Flask applications.

2. Setting Up the Content Field:

- `content = TextAreaField(...)`: This creates a field in the form where users can type their messages. `TextAreaField` is used for longer text inputs, like messages or comments.

- `"Message"`: This is a label for the field. It's like a title that tells users what this part of the form is for.

- `validators=[DataRequired(), Length(max=2000)]`: These are rules for the message field.

- `DataRequired()`: This means the field can't be empty; the user must type something.

- `Length(max=2000)`: This limits the message length to 2000 characters. It prevents users from typing overly long messages, which could be hard to handle for the app.

In simple terms, `MessageForm` is a tool for users to send messages through Hush Line. It ensures that every message has some content (it's not empty) and that it's not too long. This way, communication through Hush Line stays neat and manageable.

### Code Snippet

```
class MessageForm(FlaskForm):
    content = TextAreaField(
        "Message", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(max=2000)]
    )  # Adjust max length as needed
```

## 12. Creating the LoginForm for User Authentication

This section outlines the construction of a login form within Hush Line. It's essentially the entry gate where users provide their credentials to access their accounts.

1. Defining the LoginForm Class:

- `class LoginForm(FlaskForm)`: Here, you're defining a new class called LoginForm. By inheriting from `FlaskForm`, it's specially designed to handle form data in Flask web applications.

2. Setting Up the Username Field:

- `username = StringField("Username", validators=[DataRequired()])`: This line creates a field for the username.

- `StringField` is used for text inputs, suitable for usernames.

- `"Username"` is the label for this field, which will be displayed on the form.

- `validators=[DataRequired()]` ensures that this field cannot be left blank. Users must enter a username to proceed.

3. Setting Up the Password Field:

- `password = PasswordField("Password", validators=[DataRequired()])`: This line sets up a field for the password.

- `PasswordField` is a special type of field suitable for passwords. It hides the characters typed by the user, providing privacy and security.

- `"Password"` is the label for this field.

- `validators=[DataRequired()]` here again ensures that the user cannot leave this field blank.

In essence, the `LoginForm` acts as a straightforward yet secure way for users to log into Hush Line. It requires them to input both their username and password, enforcing that neither field can be left empty, thus maintaining a basic level of security and user verification.

### Code Snippet

```
class LoginForm(FlaskForm):
    username = StringField("Username", validators=[DataRequired()])
    password = PasswordField("Password", validators=[DataRequired()])
```

## 13. Creating the TwoFactorForm for Additional Security

This section of the code deals with setting up a form for two-factor authentication (2FA). It's like an extra security check to make sure the person trying to access an account is really who they say they are.

1. Defining the TwoFactorForm Class:

- `class TwoFactorForm(FlaskForm)`: This line creates a new class named `TwoFactorForm` that inherits from `FlaskForm`, a special type of form used in Flask applications for handling user input.

2. Setting Up the Verification Code Field:

- `verification_code = StringField("2FA Code", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=6, max=6)])`: This line creates a field for users to enter their two-factor authentication code.

- `StringField`: This type of field is used for short text inputs, like the 2FA code.

- `"2FA Code"`: This is the label for the field, telling users what information to input here.

- `validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=6, max=6)]`: These are the rules for the 2FA code field.

- `DataRequired()`: This validator ensures that the field cannot be submitted empty; the user must enter a code.

- `Length(min=6, max=6)`: This sets the length of the code to exactly 6 characters, which is a common length for 2FA codes.

In summary, the `TwoFactorForm` is an essential part of enhancing the security of Hush Line. It adds an additional layer of verification, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access after they have successfully passed this extra hurdle of entering a correct 2FA code.

### Code Snippet

```
class TwoFactorForm(FlaskForm):
    verification_code = StringField(
        "2FA Code", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=6, max=6)]
    )
```

## 14. Creating the RegistrationForm for New User Sign-ups

This section of the code is about designing a form for new users to register or sign up for Hush Line. It's like setting up an entry form for newcomers to fill out their details to create an account.

1. Defining the RegistrationForm Class:

- `class RegistrationForm(FlaskForm)`: This line starts the definition of a new class called `RegistrationForm`, which is a type of form specifically used in Flask for handling user input.

2. Setting Up the Username Field:

- `username = StringField("Username", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=4, max=25)])`: This line sets up a field for users to enter their username.

- `StringField`: This is used for text input. Here, it's for entering a username.

- `"Username"`: The label for this field.

- `validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=4, max=25)]`: These rules ensure the username is not empty (`DataRequired`) and has a length between 4 and 25 characters (`Length(min=4, max=25)`).

3. Setting Up the Password Field:

- `password = PasswordField("Password", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=18, max=128), ComplexPassword()])`: This creates a field for the password.

- `PasswordField`: This field type hides the characters typed, suitable for passwords.

- `"Password"`: The label for the password field.

- `validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=18, max=128), ComplexPassword()]`: These rules ensure the password is not empty, is between 18 and 128 characters long, and meets the complexity requirements set by the `ComplexPassword` class (like having uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters).

4. Setting Up the Invite Code Field:

- `invite_code = StringField("Invite Code", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=6, max=25)])`: This is for the invite code.

- `StringField`: Used for text input.

- `"Invite Code"`: The label for this field.

- `validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=6, max=25)]`: Ensures the invite code is not left blank and is between 6 and 25 characters long.

In summary, `RegistrationForm` provides a structured way for new users to sign up for Hush Line, ensuring they provide a username, a securely complex password, and a valid invite code. This form is an essential part of the user onboarding process, guiding them through setting up their new account with necessary security measures.

### Code Snippet

```
class RegistrationForm(FlaskForm):
    username = StringField(
        "Username", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=4, max=25)]
    )
    password = PasswordField(
        "Password",
        validators=[
            DataRequired(),
            Length(min=18, max=128),
            ComplexPassword(),
        ],
    )
    invite_code = StringField(
        "Invite Code", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=6, max=25)]
    )
```

## 15. Creating the ChangePasswordForm for Updating User Passwords

This part of the code is dedicated to allowing users to change their passwords. It's like providing a secure method for users to update their secret keys to access their accounts.

1. Defining the ChangePasswordForm Class:

- `class ChangePasswordForm(FlaskForm)`: This line introduces a new class called `ChangePasswordForm`, which, like the other forms, inherits from `FlaskForm`. This class specifically deals with the functionality required for users to change their passwords.

2. Setting Up the Old Password Field:

- `old_password = PasswordField("Old Password", validators=[DataRequired()])`: This field is for users to enter their current (old) password.

- `PasswordField`: This type of field is used for passwords, ensuring the characters typed are hidden for privacy.

- `"Old Password"`: The label for this field.

- `validators=[DataRequired()]`: This rule ensures that the field cannot be empty. Users must enter their old password to proceed with changing it.

3. Setting Up the New Password Field:

- `new_password = PasswordField("New Password", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=18, max=128), ComplexPassword()])`: This field is for users to enter their new password.

- `"New Password"`: The label for this field.

- `validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=18, max=128), ComplexPassword()]`: These rules ensure that the new password is not empty, is between 18 and 128 characters long, and meets the complexity requirements (like including uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters). This is important to maintain strong password security standards in Hush Line.

In summary, the `ChangePasswordForm` provides a structured and secure way for users to update their passwords. By requiring the current password and setting strict rules for the new password, it helps ensure that only authorized users can make such changes, thereby safeguarding user accounts from unauthorized access.

### Code Snippet

```
class ChangePasswordForm(FlaskForm):
    old_password = PasswordField("Old Password", validators=[DataRequired()])
    new_password = PasswordField(
        "New Password",
        validators=[
            DataRequired(),
            Length(min=18, max=128),
            ComplexPassword(),
        ],
    )
```

## 16. Creating the ChangeUsernameForm for Modifying Usernames

This section of the code is focused on enabling users to change their usernames. It's like providing a specific form in Hush Line where users can choose a new identity or handle.

1. Defining the ChangeUsernameForm Class:

- `class ChangeUsernameForm(FlaskForm)`: This introduces a new class named `ChangeUsernameForm`. By inheriting from `FlaskForm`, it's designed to handle the process of changing a user's username in a structured manner within Hush Line.

2. Setting Up the New Username Field:

- `new_username = StringField("New Username", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=4, max=25)])`: This creates a field for users to enter their desired new username.

- `StringField`: This type of field is used for text input, ideal for usernames.

- `"New Username"`: This is the label for the field, indicating to users where to enter their new username.

- `validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=4, max=25)]`: These rules ensure that the username field isn't left blank and that the entered username falls within a specific length range (between 4 and 25 characters). This ensures usernames are not too short (for uniqueness) and not too long (for ease of use).

In summary, the `ChangeUsernameForm` is a specialized tool within Hush Line that manages the process of username changes. It ensures that users adhere to certain guidelines while choosing a new username, maintaining a balance between user freedom and system requirements for identity management.

### Code Snippet

```
class ChangeUsernameForm(FlaskForm):
    new_username = StringField(
        "New Username", validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=4, max=25)]
    )
```

## 17. Creating the SMTPSettingsForm for Email Server Configuration

This part of the code is designed to allow users to configure settings related to sending emails. SMTP, which stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is the standard protocol for sending emails across the Internet. This form allows users to input their email server details.

1. Defining the SMTPSettingsForm Class:

- `class SMTPSettingsForm(FlaskForm)`: This line introduces a new class, `SMTPSettingsForm`, which extends `FlaskForm`. It's specially crafted to handle the input of SMTP settings, which are necessary for email functionalities in Hush Line.

2. Setting Up Various Fields for SMTP Settings:

- `email = StringField("Email", validators=[DataRequired(), Email()])`: This field is for the user's email address.

- `StringField`: Suitable for text input, like an email address.

- `"Email"`: The label for this field.

- `validators=[DataRequired(), Email()]`: Ensures the field is not left blank and that the input is a valid email format.

- `smtp_server = StringField("SMTP Server", validators=[DataRequired()])`: For the address of the SMTP server.

- "SMTP Server": Label for the SMTP server field.

- `DataRequired`: Ensures the field is not empty.

- `smtp_port = IntegerField("SMTP Port", validators=[DataRequired()])`: For the port number used by the SMTP server.

- `IntegerField`: Appropriate for numeric input.

- `"SMTP Port"`: Label for the SMTP port field.

- smtp_username = StringField("SMTP Username", validators=[DataRequired()]): For the username used to access the SMTP server.

- "SMTP Username": Label for this field.

- `smtp_password = PasswordField("SMTP Password", validators=[DataRequired()])`: For the password associated with the SMTP username.

- `PasswordField`: Ensures the entered characters are concealed for privacy.

- `"SMTP Password"`: Label for the SMTP password field.

In summary, the `SMTPSettingsForm` provides a structured and secure way for users to enter their email server settings. This form is crucial for enabling email functionalities in Hush Line, such as sending notifications or verification emails, by collecting the necessary details for connecting to an SMTP server.

### Code Snippet

```
class SMTPSettingsForm(FlaskForm):
    email = StringField("Email", validators=[DataRequired(), Email()])
    smtp_server = StringField("SMTP Server", validators=[DataRequired()])
    smtp_port = IntegerField("SMTP Port", validators=[DataRequired()])
    smtp_username = StringField("SMTP Username", validators=[DataRequired()])
    smtp_password = PasswordField("SMTP Password", validators=[DataRequired()])
```

## 18. Creating the PGPKeyForm for PGP Key Submission

This section of the code focuses on a form designed for users to submit their PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) keys. PGP keys are used for secure communication, allowing messages to be encrypted in a way that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read.

1. Defining the PGPKeyForm Class:

- `class PGPKeyForm(FlaskForm)`: This line starts the definition of a new class called `PGPKeyForm`, which inherits from `FlaskForm`. This form is specifically for handling the submission of PGP keys within Hush Line.

2. Setting Up the PGP Key Field:

- `pgp_key = TextAreaField("PGP Key", validators=[Length(max=5000)])`: This creates a large text area for users to input their PGP key.

- `TextAreaField`: This type of field is suitable for longer text input, which is necessary for PGP keys as they tend to be lengthy.

- `"PGP Key"`: The label for the field, clearly indicating where users should enter their PGP key.

- `validators=[Length(max=5000)]`: This validator ensures the submitted key doesn't exceed 5000 characters. It's important to set a reasonable limit to ensure that the data is manageable and to protect the system from excessively large inputs.

In summary, the `PGPKeyForm` provides a user-friendly way for individuals to submit their PGP keys, facilitating encrypted communication. By including this form in Hush Line, you offer users an additional layer of security for their communications, aligning with best practices in data privacy and security.

### Code Snippet

```
class PGPKeyForm(FlaskForm):
    pgp_key = TextAreaField("PGP Key", validators=[Length(max=5000)])
```

## 19. Creating the DisplayNameForm for User Profile Customization

This section of the code focuses on a form that allows users to set or change their display name. This is a feature that adds a personal touch to user profiles, as a display name is often what appears to other users within the application.

1. Defining the DisplayNameForm Class:

- `class DisplayNameForm(FlaskForm)`: Here, you're defining a new class called `DisplayNameForm`, which extends from `FlaskForm`. This form is specifically tailored for users to input or update their display name—a name they choose to be identified by in Hush Line.

2. Setting Up the Display Name Field:

- `display_name = StringField("Display Name", validators=[Length(max=100)])`: This creates a field for users to enter their chosen display name.

- `StringField: Suitable for short to medium length text input, perfect for a name.

- `"Display Name"`: The label for this field, guiding users on what information to enter.

- `validators=[Length(max=100)]`: This ensures the display name is within a reasonable length (not exceeding 100 characters). It's long enough to allow creativity but short enough to maintain readability and consistency within the app's interface.

In summary, the DisplayNameForm offers a simple yet effective way for users to personalize their presence in Hush Line by choosing a display name. It enhances user experience by allowing a level of personalization, while the length validator ensures that display names remain practical and user-friendly within the app's context.

### Code Snippet

```
class DisplayNameForm(FlaskForm):
    display_name = StringField("Display Name", validators=[Length(max=100)])
```

## 20. Implementing a 2FA Requirement Decorator

This section of the code defines a decorator function, `require_2fa`, which is used to enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) on certain routes or functions in Hush Line. A decorator in Python is a tool that lets you modify or extend the behavior of a function in a reusable way.

1. Defining the require_2fa Decorator:

- `def require_2fa(f)`: This is the definition of the decorator. It takes a function `f` as an argument, which represents any Flask route or view function you want to protect with 2FA.

2. The Decorated Function:

- `@wraps(f)`: This is a decorator from the `functools` module. It's used to preserve information about the original function `f`, like its name and docstring.

- `def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs)`: This defines the new function that will replace `f` when `require_2fa` is applied. It can accept any number of arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`), making it flexible for various types of functions.

3. Checking Authentication and 2FA Status:

- The first if statement checks if the user is not logged in (`"user_id" not in session`) or is not authenticated (`not session.get("is_authenticated", False)`). If either condition is true, the user is redirected to the login page with a message to complete authentication.

- The second if statement checks if 2FA is required (`session.get("2fa_required", False)`) and not yet verified (`not session.get("2fa_verified", False)`). If so, the user is redirected to the 2FA verification page with a message indicating that 2FA verification is needed.

4. Returning the Original Function:

- If none of the above conditions are met (meaning the user is authenticated and has completed 2FA verification, if required), the original function `f` is called with its arguments, allowing the request to proceed normally.

In summary, `require_2fa` is a security feature that ensures certain parts of Hush Line are only accessible to users who have completed the necessary authentication steps, including 2FA when it's required. By using this decorator, you can easily apply these security checks to any route or view function in Hush Line, enhancing overall security.

### Code Snippet

```
def require_2fa(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if "user_id" not in session or not session.get("is_authenticated", False):
            flash("👉 Please complete authentication.")
            return redirect(url_for("login"))
        if session.get("2fa_required", False) and not session.get(
            "2fa_verified", False
        ):
            flash("👉 2FA verification required.")
            return redirect(url_for("verify_2fa_login"))
        return f(*args, **kwargs)

    return decorated_function
```

## 21. Setting Up a Global Error Handler

This section of the code establishes a global error handler for Hush Line. It's like setting up a safety net to catch and handle any unexpected errors that occur anywhere in the app.

1. Defining the Error Handler:

- `@app.errorhandler(Exception)`: This is a decorator provided by Flask. It tells Hush Line, "If an error happens, use the function below to handle it." The `Exception` part means it will catch any kind of general exception, which is a broad category encompassing most errors that could occur during execution.

2. The Error Handling Function:

- `def handle_exception(e)`: This function is called whenever an error is caught. The `e` parameter represents the exception object, which contains information about what went wrong.

- Inside the function:

    - `app.logger.error(f"Error: {e}", exc_info=True)`: This line logs the error. The `exc_info=True` argument tells the logger to include detailed information about the exception, including a traceback, which is like a map showing where in the code the error happened.

    - `return "An internal server error occurred", 500`: This sends a response back to the user. The message "An internal server error occurred" is a general message indicating something went wrong, and `500` is the HTTP status code for an internal server error. This response lets the user know that the error is on the server side, not theirs.

In summary, this global error handler is a crucial part of maintaining the stability and user-friendliness of Hush Line. It ensures that if something unexpected happens, Hush Line can log it properly and let the user know in a generic but informative way, rather than crashing or behaving unpredictably.

### Code Snippet

```
# Error Handler
@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_exception(e):
    # Log the error and stacktrace
    app.logger.error(f"Error: {e}", exc_info=True)
    return "An internal server error occurred", 500
```

## 22. Setting Up the Index Route with User Redirection Logic

This part of the code defines the behavior of the root or index route (`"/"`) of Hush Line. It's like setting up the main entrance of Hush Line and deciding where to direct users when they arrive.

1. Defining the Index Route:

- `@app.route("/")`: This decorator tells Flask, "When someone visits the home page (like 'www.yourapp.com/'), use the function below to decide what to show them."

- `def index()`: This function is what Flask will run when someone visits the root URL.

2. User Session Check and Redirection Logic:

- The function first checks if a `user_id` is present in the session: `if "user_id" in session`. The session is a way to remember information from one request to another. Here, it's checking if the user has already logged in.

- If there's a `user_id`:

    - `user = User.query.get(session["user_id"])`: This line attempts to retrieve the user's details from the database.

    - If a user is found (`if user`), the function redirects them to their inbox (`return redirect(url_for("inbox", username=user.username))`). This is like saying, "Welcome back! Let's go to your inbox."

    - If no user is found in the database matching the `user_id` in the session, it could mean the user data is not valid or the account was deleted. The user is shown a message (`flash("🫥 User not found. Please log in again.")`) and redirected to the login page (`return redirect(url_for("login"))`). The invalid `user_id` is also removed from the session for security and cleanliness.

- If there's no `user_id` in the session, it means the visitor is not logged in, so they are simply redirected to the login page.

In summary, this route acts as a smart gatekeeper for Hush Line. When a user visits the main page, it checks whether they are already logged in and directs them accordingly - either to their inbox if they're recognized or to the login page if they're not. This provides a seamless experience for returning users and a clear entry point for new or logged-out users.

### Code Snippet

```
# Routes
@app.route("/")
def index():
    if "user_id" in session:
        user = User.query.get(session["user_id"])
        if user:
            return redirect(url_for("inbox", username=user.username))
        else:
            # Handle case where user ID in session does not exist in the database
            flash("🫥 User not found. Please log in again.")
            session.pop("user_id", None)  # Clear the invalid user_id from session
            return redirect(url_for("login"))
    else:
        return redirect(url_for("login"))
```

## 23. Implementing the Registration Route with User Signup Logic

This section of the code defines the functionality for the `/register` route, which handles new user registrations in Hush Line. It's like setting up a sign-up desk where new users can create their accounts.

1. Defining the Registration Route:

- `@app.route("/register", methods=["GET", "POST"])`: This decorator tells Flask that the function below should be used to handle requests to the `/register` URL. It accepts both GET and POST methods – GET for displaying the registration form and POST for processing the form data submitted by the user.

- `def register()`: This is the function that will be executed when a user visits the `/register` route.

2. Handling User Registration:

- `form = RegistrationForm()`: This creates an instance of `RegistrationForm`, which will be used to gather user input.

- `if form.validate_on_submit()`: This checks if the form has been submitted and if the data provided passes all the validation rules.

    - If yes, the user's input is extracted (`username = form.username.data`, etc.).

    - The invite code provided by the user is checked to ensure it's valid and not expired. If there's any issue with the invite code, a flash message is shown, and the user is redirected back to the registration page.

    - The application checks if the chosen username is already taken. If it is, a message is flashed, and the user is redirected to try again.

    - If the invite code is valid and the username is available, the user's password is hashed for security, and a new User instance is created.

    - The new user is added to the database, and the invite code is marked as used.

    - A success message is flashed, and the user is redirected to the login page to sign in with their new credentials.

3. Rendering the Registration Form:

- `return render_template("register.html", form=form)`: This renders the registration form template, passing the form instance to the template. When a user first visits the `/register` URL, or if there's a need to correct the input, they see the registration form where they can enter their details.

In summary, this route provides a complete user registration process, from presenting a form to collecting and validating user inputs, and finally creating a new user account. It includes checks for invite code validity and username uniqueness, ensuring a smooth and secure signup experience for new users.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/register", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def register():
    form = RegistrationForm()

    if form.validate_on_submit():
        username = form.username.data
        password = form.password.data
        invite_code_input = form.invite_code.data

        # Validate the invite code
        invite_code = InviteCode.query.filter_by(
            code=invite_code_input, used=False
        ).first()
        if not invite_code or invite_code.expiration_date < datetime.utcnow():
            flash("⛔️ Invalid or expired invite code.", "error")
            return redirect(url_for("register"))

        # Check for existing username
        if User.query.filter_by(username=username).first():
            flash("💔 Username already taken.", "error")
            return redirect(url_for("register"))

        # Hash the password and create the user
        password_hash = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password).decode("utf-8")
        new_user = User(username=username, password_hash=password_hash)

        # Add user and mark invite code as used
        db.session.add(new_user)
        invite_code.used = True
        db.session.commit()

        flash("👍 Registration successful! Please log in.", "success")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    return render_template("register.html", form=form)
```

## 24. Implementing the Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) Route

This part of the code handles the process of enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for a user's account. 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, typically a temporary code, in addition to the password.

1. Defining the Enable 2FA Route:

- `@app.route("/enable-2fa", methods=["GET", "POST"])`: This sets up the route `/enable-2fa` to handle both GET and POST requests. GET is used to display the 2FA setup form, and POST is for processing the form data.

2. User Authentication Check:

- The function first checks if the user is logged in by looking for `user_id` in the session. If not found, it redirects to the login page.

3. Handling 2FA Setup Process:

- The user's details are retrieved from the database using their `user_id`.

- A `TwoFactorForm` instance is created for handling the 2FA verification code input.

- When the form is submitted (`form.validate_on_submit()`):

    - The entered verification code is compared with the temporary 2FA secret stored in the session.

    - If the verification is successful, the temporary 2FA secret is saved as the user's permanent `totp_secret`, and the user is logged out to re-login with 2FA enabled.

    - If the verification fails, a message is flashed, and the user is prompted to try again.

4. Generating 2FA Secret and QR Code:

- If the user is visiting the page to set up 2FA (not submitting the form), a new 2FA secret is generated.

- This secret is used to create a QR code and a text-based pairing code. The QR code can be scanned with a 2FA app (like Google Authenticator), which will then generate temporary codes for the user to enter alongside their password when logging in.

- The QR code image is prepared for display on the webpage and passed along with the form and text code to the template.

5. Rendering the 2FA Setup Page:

- `return render_template("enable_2fa.html", ...)`: This renders the 2FA setup page, providing the user with the form, QR code image, and text-based code for setting up 2FA on their account.

In summary, this route provides users with a secure way to set up two-factor authentication for their accounts. It involves generating a unique 2FA secret, verifying it through a user-submitted code, and providing a QR code for easy setup with authentication apps. This significantly enhances account security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to the usual password.

    )
```

## 25. Implementing the Disable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) Route

This part of the code provides functionality for users to disable two-factor authentication (2FA) for their accounts. It's a feature that allows users to revert to standard password-only login.

1. Defining the Disable 2FA Route:

- `@app.route("/disable-2fa", methods=["POST"])`: This sets up the route `/disable-2fa` to handle POST requests. The POST method is used because this action changes data on the server (specifically, it changes a user's 2FA settings), and POST is more secure for this type of operation than GET.

2. User Authentication Check:

- The function begins by checking if a `user_id` is present in the session, confirming that the user is logged in. If there's no `user_id`, the user is redirected to the login page.

3. Disabling 2FA for the User:

- The user's details are retrieved from the database.

- The user's `totp_secret`, which is essential for generating 2FA codes, is set to `None`. This effectively disables 2FA for their account.

- The change is committed to the database with `db.session.commit()`.

4. Flashing a Confirmation Message and Redirecting:

- A flash message (`flash("🔓 2FA has been disabled.")`) informs the user that 2FA has been successfully disabled.

- The user is then redirected to the settings page with `return redirect(url_for("settings"))`.

In summary, this route allows users to easily disable two-factor authentication for their accounts. It's a straightforward process that ensures users have control over their security settings, allowing them to disable 2FA if it becomes inconvenient or if they prefer to use only their password for authentication. The route ensures that such changes are made securely and provides clear feedback to the user about the change in their account's security settings.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/disable-2fa", methods=["POST"])
def disable_2fa():
    user_id = session.get("user_id")
    if not user_id:
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = db.session.get(User, user_id)
    user.totp_secret = None
    db.session.commit()
    flash("🔓 2FA has been disabled.")
    return redirect(url_for("settings"))
```

## 26. Implementing a Confirmation Page for Disabling 2FA

This section of the code sets up a route in Hush Line to display a confirmation page for disabling two-factor authentication (2FA). It acts as a safeguard, asking users to confirm their decision before 2FA is actually turned off.

1. Defining the Confirm Disable 2FA Route:

- `@app.route("/confirm-disable-2fa", methods=["GET"])`: This decorator creates the route `/confirm-disable-2fa` for handling GET requests. GET is appropriate here because this route is used to display a confirmation page, not to submit data changes.

- `def confirm_disable_2fa()`: This is the function that Flask will execute when a user navigates to the `/confirm-disable-2fa` URL.

2. Rendering the Confirmation Page:

- `return render_template("confirm_disable_2fa.html")`: This line tells Flask to display the webpage `confirm_disable_2fa.html`. This webpage should contain information asking the user to confirm whether they really want to disable 2FA on their account. It's an important step to prevent users from accidentally disabling a crucial security feature.

In summary, the `/confirm-disable-2fa` route is dedicated to showing users a confirmation page before they disable 2FA. This step ensures that users are fully aware of the action they're about to take and its implications for their account security. By requiring this additional confirmation, Hush Line helps prevent unintentional changes to security settings.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/confirm-disable-2fa", methods=["GET"])
def confirm_disable_2fa():
    return render_template("confirm_disable_2fa.html")
```

## 27. Displaying QR Code for 2FA Setup

This section of the code defines a route in Hush Line for displaying a QR code that users can use to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) with their accounts. The QR code simplifies the process of adding the 2FA account to a compatible app like Google Authenticator.

1. Defining the Show QR Code Route:

- `@app.route("/show-qr-code")`: This sets up the route `/show-qr-code` for handling GET requests. When a user navigates to this URL, Flask executes the function defined below.

- `def show_qr_code()`: This function is called to display the QR code page.

2. User Verification and 2FA Check:

- The function begins by fetching the user's details from the database using the `user_id` stored in the session.

- It then checks if the user exists and if they have a `totp_secret` (the secret key used for generating 2FA codes). If either condition fails, the user is redirected to the 2FA setup page (`enable_2fa`).

3. Generating and Preparing the QR Code:

- `pyotp.totp.TOTP(user.totp_secret).provisioning_uri(...)`: This line generates a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for the user's 2FA setup, which includes their username and the issuer's name (in this case, "Hush Line").

- `qrcode.make(totp_uri)`: Using the generated URI, a QR code is created.

- The QR code is then converted into a format (base64-encoded string) suitable for embedding directly into a web page.

4. Rendering the QR Code Page:

- `return render_template("show_qr_code.html", ...)`: This line renders the `show_qr_code.html` template, passing the QR code image, the form, and the user's 2FA secret to the template. This allows the QR code to be displayed on the webpage along with any other necessary information or forms.

In summary, the `/show-qr-code` route provides a user-friendly way for individuals to set up 2FA on their accounts. By scanning the displayed QR code with a 2FA app, users can easily add an extra layer of security to their account, enhancing the overall protection of their personal data within Hush Line.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/show-qr-code")
def show_qr_code():
    user = User.query.get(session["user_id"])
    if not user or not user.totp_secret:
        return redirect(url_for("enable_2fa"))

    form = TwoFactorForm()

    totp_uri = pyotp.totp.TOTP(user.totp_secret).provisioning_uri(
        name=user.username, issuer_name="Hush Line"
    )
    img = qrcode.make(totp_uri)

    # Convert QR code to a data URI
    buffered = io.BytesIO()
    img.save(buffered)
    img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode()
    qr_code_img = f"data:image/png;base64,{img_str}"

    return render_template(
        "show_qr_code.html",
        form=form,
        qr_code_img=qr_code_img,
        user_secret=user.totp_secret,
    )
```

## 28. Implementing the 2FA Setup Verification Route

This portion of the code is dedicated to verifying the two-factor authentication (2FA) setup for a user. It's a crucial step in ensuring that the user has correctly configured 2FA for their account, enhancing security.

1. Defining the 2FA Verification Route:

- `@app.route("/verify-2fa-setup", methods=["POST"])`: This sets up the route `/verify-2fa-setup` to handle POST requests. The POST method is used because this route processes data submitted from a form (the 2FA verification code).

2. User Authentication and Retrieval:

- The function begins by checking if a `user_id` is in the session and retrieving the user's details from the database. If the `user_id` is not found (indicating the user is not logged in), it redirects to the login page.

3. 2FA Code Verification:

- `verification_code = request.form["verification_code"]`: This line retrieves the 2FA code entered by the user from the form data.

- `pyotp.TOTP(user.totp_secret)`: A TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) object is created using the user's totp_secret.

- `if totp.verify(verification_code)`: The entered verification code is checked against the TOTP object. If the code is correct, it means the user has successfully set up 2FA.

    - A success message is flashed, and the `is_setting_up_2fa` flag is removed from the session.

    - The user is then redirected to the logout route, prompting them to log in again but now with 2FA enabled.

- If the verification fails (else clause), a message indicating an invalid code is flashed, and the user is redirected back to the QR code display page to try again.

In summary, the `/verify-2fa-setup` route is an essential part of the 2FA setup process. It checks whether the user has correctly configured their 2FA by verifying the code they provide. This step ensures that the user's 2FA setup is functional and secure before they continue using their account with this added layer of security.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/verify-2fa-setup", methods=["POST"])
def verify_2fa_setup():
    user = User.query.get(session["user_id"])
    if not user:
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    verification_code = request.form["verification_code"]
    totp = pyotp.TOTP(user.totp_secret)
    if totp.verify(verification_code):
        flash("👍 2FA setup successful. Please log in again.")
        session.pop("is_setting_up_2fa", None)
        return redirect(url_for("logout"))
    else:
        flash("⛔️ Invalid 2FA code. Please try again.")
        return redirect(url_for("show_qr_code"))
```

## 29. Implementing the Login Route with Authentication Logic

This section of the code handles the login functionality for Hush Line. It's a critical component that manages user access by verifying their credentials and determining the need for additional security measures like 2FA.

1. Defining the Login Route:

- `@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])`: This sets up the `/login` route to handle both GET and POST requests. GET is used for displaying the login form, while POST processes the submitted form data.

2. Processing Login Requests:

- `form = LoginForm()`: A `LoginForm` instance is created to handle input from the user.

- `if form.validate_on_submit()`: This checks if the form has been submitted and if the inputs are valid.

    - The user's username and password are retrieved from the form data.

    - The application then checks if there is a user with the given username and whether the provided password matches the hashed password in the database.

    - If the credentials are correct:

    - User details are stored in the session, including their `user_id` and `username`. This keeps the user logged in as they navigate through different parts of the application.

    - The session variables `is_authenticated`, `2fa_required`, and `2fa_verified` are set appropriately. `is_authenticated` indicates that the user has successfully logged in, `2fa_required` checks if 2FA is enabled for the user, and `2fa_verified` is initially set to `False`.

    - If 2FA is enabled for the user (`user.totp_secret`), they are redirected to the `verify_2fa_login` route to complete the 2FA verification. Otherwise, they are granted direct access to their inbox (`redirect(url_for("inbox", username=username))`).

- If the credentials are incorrect, a flash message is shown to the user, indicating an invalid username or password.

3. Rendering the Login Page:

- `return render_template("login.html", form=form)`: If the request is a GET request or the form submission is not valid, the login page is rendered, presenting the user with the `LoginForm` to fill out.

In summary, the `/login` route is essential for user authentication in Hush Line. It securely validates user credentials, manages user sessions, and integrates with the 2FA setup if required. This route ensures that only authorized users can access their accounts, providing a secure and user-friendly login process.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    form = LoginForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        username = form.username.data
        password = form.password.data

        user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()

        if user and bcrypt.check_password_hash(user.password_hash, password):
            session["user_id"] = user.id
            session["username"] = user.username
            session["is_authenticated"] = True  # User is authenticated
            session["2fa_required"] = user.totp_secret is not None
            session["2fa_verified"] = False

            if user.totp_secret:
                return redirect(url_for("verify_2fa_login"))
            else:
                session["2fa_verified"] = True  # Direct login if 2FA not enabled
                return redirect(url_for("inbox", username=username))
        else:
            flash("Invalid username or password")

    return render_template("login.html", form=form)
```

## 30. Implementing the 2FA Verification Route for Login

This section of the code is dedicated to verifying a user's two-factor authentication (2FA) code during the login process. It's a crucial step for enhancing security by ensuring that the user logging in has access to the 2FA device or app associated with their account.

1. Defining the 2FA Verification Route:

- `@app.route("/verify-2fa-login", methods=["GET", "POST"])`: This sets up the route `/verify-2fa-login` to handle both GET and POST requests. GET displays the 2FA verification form, while POST processes the form submission.

2. User Authentication and 2FA Requirement Check:

- The function begins by checking if a user is logged in and if 2FA verification is required (`"user_id" not in session or not session.get("2fa_required", False)`). If not, the user is redirected to the login page.

- It then retrieves the logged-in user's details from the database. If the user cannot be found, the session is cleared for security reasons, and the user is redirected to log in again.

3. Handling 2FA Code Submission:

- `form = TwoFactorForm()`: A form instance is created to handle the 2FA verification code input.

- `if form.validate_on_submit()`: This checks if the form has been submitted and the input is valid.

    - The submitted 2FA code is verified against the user's `totp_secret` stored in the database.

    - If the code is correct (`totp.verify(verification_code)`), the `2fa_verified` session variable is set to `True`, indicating successful 2FA verification. The user is then redirected to their inbox.

    - If the verification code is incorrect, a message is flashed, and the user remains on the 2FA verification page to try again.

4. Rendering the 2FA Verification Page:

- `return render_template("verify_2fa_login.html", form=form)`: This renders the template for the 2FA verification page, passing the `TwoFactorForm` to it. Users are presented with this form to enter their 2FA code.

In summary, the `/verify-2fa-login` route is an essential security feature of Hush Line. It ensures that the second layer of authentication is completed by users who have 2FA enabled. By requiring users to enter a valid 2FA code before granting access to their accounts, this route significantly enhances the overall security of user logins.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/verify-2fa-login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def verify_2fa_login():
    # Redirect to login if user is not authenticated
    if "user_id" not in session or not session.get("2fa_required", False):
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = User.query.get(session["user_id"])
    if not user:
        flash("🫥 User not found. Please login again.")
        session.clear()  # Clearing the session for security
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    form = TwoFactorForm()

    if form.validate_on_submit():
        verification_code = form.verification_code.data
        totp = pyotp.TOTP(user.totp_secret)
        if totp.verify(verification_code):
            session["2fa_verified"] = True  # Set 2FA verification flag
            return redirect(url_for("inbox", username=user.username))
        else:
            flash("⛔️ Invalid 2FA code. Please try again.")

    return render_template("verify_2fa_login.html", form=form)
```

## 31. Implementing the Inbox Route with Access Control and Message Retrieval

This part of the code defines the functionality for the user's inbox in Hush Line. It's where users can view their messages, ensuring that only authorized and properly authenticated users have access.

1. Defining the Inbox Route with 2FA Check:

- `@app.route("/inbox/<username>")`: This sets up the route `/inbox/<username>` to display the inbox of a user. The `<username>` part in the route is a variable, meaning this route can handle requests for any user's inbox, depending on the username provided in the URL.

- `@require_2fa`: This decorator, applied before the route function, ensures that 2FA verification is completed for users who have it enabled before they can access their inbox.

2. User Authentication and Verification:

- The function starts by verifying if the user is logged in (`"user_id" not in session`). If not, it redirects them to the login page.

- It then fetches the logged-in user's details from the database. If the user cannot be found (perhaps due to an invalid session), it clears the `user_id` from the session and redirects to the login page.

- The function checks if the logged-in user's username matches the username in the requested URL. If not, it flashes an unauthorized access message and redirects to the login page. This prevents users from accessing someone else's inbox.

- It also ensures that 2FA has been verified for users who have it enabled. If not verified, it redirects them to complete 2FA verification.

3. Retrieving and Displaying Messages:

- The user's messages are retrieved from the database (`Message.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).order_by(Message.id.desc()).all()`), ordered by their IDs in descending order, so the newest messages appear first.

- `return render_template("inbox.html", messages=messages, user=user)`: The inbox page is rendered, passing the user's messages and their details to the template. This allows the user to view all their messages in the inbox.

In summary, the `/inbox/<username>` route provides a secure and user-specific inbox functionality. It ensures that users can only access their own inbox and only after they've passed necessary authentication checks, including 2FA if enabled. This design maintains user privacy and security, allowing users to view and manage their messages safely.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/inbox/<username>")
@require_2fa
def inbox(username):
    # Redirect to login if not logged in
    if "user_id" not in session:
        flash("Please log in to access your inbox.")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = User.query.get(session["user_id"])
    if not user:
        flash("🫥 User not found. Please log in again.")
        session.pop("user_id", None)
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    # Check if the session username matches the requested inbox
    if session.get("username") != username:
        flash("⛔️ Unauthorized access.")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    # Check if 2FA is verified for users with 2FA enabled
    if user.totp_secret and not session.get("2fa_verified", False):
        return redirect(url_for("verify_2fa_login"))

    # Fetch messages for the user, ordered by ID in descending order
    messages = (
        Message.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).order_by(Message.id.desc()).all()
    )
    return render_template("inbox.html", messages=messages, user=user)
```

## 32. Implementing the User Settings Route with Multiple Form Handlers

This part of the code is designed to manage the user settings in Hush Line. It provides a comprehensive interface for users to update various aspects of their account, including display name, SMTP settings for email, PGP key for secure communication, password, and username.

1. Defining the Settings Route with 2FA Check:

- `@app.route("/settings", methods=["GET", "POST"])`: This sets up the `/settings` route to handle both GET requests (to display the settings page) and POST requests (to process changes submitted by the user).

- `@require_2fa`: This decorator ensures that the settings page is only accessible to users who have completed 2FA verification, enhancing security.

2. User Authentication and Retrieval:

- The function starts by checking if the user is logged in. If not, it redirects to the login page.

- The user's details are fetched from the database using their `user_id` from the session.

3. Initializing Forms for Settings:

- Multiple form instances are created for different settings: `ChangePasswordForm`, `ChangeUsernameForm`, `SMTPSettingsForm`, `PGPKeyForm`, and `DisplayNameForm`.

4. Handling Form Submissions:

- The function checks if a POST request has been made and processes the form data accordingly.

    - Display Name: If the display name form is submitted and valid, the user's display name is updated in the database.

    - SMTP Settings: If the SMTP settings form is submitted and valid, the user's email server settings are updated.

    - PGP Key: If the PGP key form is submitted and valid, the user's PGP key is updated.

    - Password Change: If the change password form is submitted, it verifies the old password and, if correct, updates it to the new password.

    - Username Change: If the change username form is submitted and the new username is not already taken, it updates the user's username.

- After each successful update, a flash message is shown, and the user is redirected back to the settings page.

5. Prepopulating Form Fields and Rendering the Settings Page:

- Form fields are prepopulated with the user's current settings (like email, SMTP server, etc.) for convenience.

- `return render_template(...)`: This renders the `settings.html` template, passing all the form instances and user data to it. This allows the user to view and change their settings on a single integrated page.

In summary, the `/settings` route provides a centralized and secure interface for users to manage various aspects of their account settings. It ensures that changes are made in a controlled and authenticated environment, with clear feedback provided to the user for each action they perform.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/settings", methods=["GET", "POST"])
@require_2fa
def settings():
    # Redirect to login if not logged in
    if "user_id" not in session:
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = User.query.get(session["user_id"])
    if not user:
        flash("🫥 User not found.")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    # Initialize forms

    change_username_form = ChangeUsernameForm()
    smtp_settings_form = SMTPSettingsForm()
    pgp_key_form = PGPKeyForm()
    display_name_form = DisplayNameForm()

    # Handle form submissions
    if request.method == "POST":
        # Handle Display Name Form Submission
        if (
            "update_display_name" in request.form
            and display_name_form.validate_on_submit()
        ):
            if display_name_form.display_name.data.strip():
                user.display_name = display_name_form.display_name.data.strip()
            else:
                user.display_name = None

            user.email = smtp_settings_form.email.data
            user.smtp_server = smtp_settings_form.smtp_server.data
            user.smtp_port = smtp_settings_form.smtp_port.data
            user.smtp_username = smtp_settings_form.smtp_username.data
            user.smtp_password = smtp_settings_form.smtp_password.data
            db.session.commit()

        if change_password_form.validate_on_submit():
            if bcrypt.check_password_hash(
                user.password_hash, change_password_form.old_password.data
            ):
                user.password_hash = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(
                    change_password_form.new_password.data
                ).decode("utf-8")
                db.session.commit()
                flash("👍 Password changed successfully.")
            else:
                flash("⛔️ Incorrect old password.")
            return redirect(url_for("settings"))

        # Handle Change Username Form Submission
        elif change_username_form.validate_on_submit():
            existing_user = User.query.filter_by(
                username=change_username_form.new_username.data
            ).first()
            if existing_user:
                flash("💔 This username is already taken.")
            else:
                user.username = change_username_form.new_username.data
                db.session.commit()
                session["username"] = user.username
                flash("👍 Username changed successfully.")
            return redirect(url_for("settings"))

    # Prepopulate form fields
    smtp_settings_form.email.data = user.email
    smtp_settings_form.smtp_server.data = user.smtp_server
    smtp_settings_form.smtp_port.data = user.smtp_port
    smtp_settings_form.smtp_username.data = user.smtp_username
    pgp_key_form.pgp_key.data = user.pgp_key
    display_name_form.display_name.data = user.display_name or user.username

    return render_template(
        "settings.html",
        user=user,
        smtp_settings_form=smtp_settings_form,
        change_password_form=change_password_form,
        change_username_form=change_username_form,
        pgp_key_form=pgp_key_form,
        display_name_form=display_name_form,
    )
```

## 33. Implementing the Toggle 2FA Route for Enabling or Disabling Two-Factor Authentication

This section of the code provides a route for toggling the two-factor authentication (2FA) setting for a user's account. It acts as a switch to either enable or disable 2FA based on the current status of the user's 2FA configuration.

1. Defining the Toggle 2FA Route:

- `@app.route("/toggle-2fa", methods=["POST"])`: This sets up the `/toggle-2fa` route to handle POST requests. POST is used here because this route triggers a change in the user's account settings (specifically, their 2FA status).

2. User Authentication Check:

- The function first checks if the user is logged in by looking for `user_id` in the session. If not, the user is redirected to the login page.

3. Determining and Redirecting Based on 2FA Status:

- The user's details are retrieved from the database.

- `if user.totp_secret`: This condition checks if the user already has a 2FA secret set up. The presence of a `totp_secret` indicates that 2FA is currently enabled.

    - If 2FA is enabled (`user.totp_secret` is present), the function redirects the user to the /disable-2fa route to proceed with disabling 2FA.

    - If 2FA is not enabled (`user.totp_secret` is absent), the function redirects the user to the `/enable-2fa` route to start the process of enabling 2FA.

In summary, the `/toggle-2fa` route acts as a quick switch for users to either enable or disable 2FA for their accounts. By checking the current status of 2FA and redirecting to the appropriate route, it simplifies the user experience, making the process of managing 2FA settings more intuitive and accessible.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/toggle-2fa", methods=["POST"])
def toggle_2fa():
    user_id = session.get("user_id")
    if not user_id:
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = db.session.get(User, user_id)
    if user.totp_secret:
        return redirect(url_for("disable_2fa"))
    else:
        return redirect(url_for("enable_2fa"))
```

## 34. Implementing the Change Password Functionality

This section of the code focuses on allowing users to change their account password. It's an essential feature for maintaining account security and allowing users to update their credentials.

1. Defining the Change Password Route:

- `@app.route("/change-password", methods=["POST"])`: This sets up the `/change-password` route to handle POST requests, which is appropriate since changing the password involves submitting sensitive data that should not be exposed in a URL.

2. User Authentication Check:

- The function begins by checking if a `user_id` is in the session, which confirms the user is logged in. If there's no `user_id`, the user is redirected to the login page.

3. Retrieving User Data and Initializing Forms:

- The user's details are fetched from the database using the `user_id`.

- Instances of various forms are created, including `ChangePasswordForm` for handling the password change request, and other forms like `ChangeUsernameForm`, `SMTPSettingsForm`, `PGPKeyForm`, and `DisplayNameForm` which might be used in the `settings.html` template.

4. Processing the Change Password Form:

- `if change_password_form.validate_on_submit()`: This checks if the change password form has been submitted and the input is valid.

    - The old password provided by the user is verified against the stored hash. If it matches (`bcrypt.check_password_hash`), the password is updated with the new one.

    - The new password is hashed for security and then stored in the database.

    - A success message is flashed, and the user is redirected to the settings page.

    - If the old password does not match, a flash message indicates an incorrect old password.

5. Rendering the Settings Page:

- `return render_template(...)`: If the form has not been submitted or the old password doesn't match, the settings page is rendered again, along with all the form instances. This allows the user to retry or change other settings as needed.

In summary, the `/change-password` route provides a secure and user-friendly way for individuals to update their passwords. This functionality is key to any application's security, allowing users to change their passwords regularly or if they suspect their account security has been compromised.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/change-password", methods=["POST"])
def change_password():
    user_id = session.get("user_id")
    if not user_id:
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    # Retrieve the user using the user_id
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    change_password_form = ChangePasswordForm(request.form)
    change_username_form = ChangeUsernameForm()
    smtp_settings_form = SMTPSettingsForm()
    pgp_key_form = PGPKeyForm()
    display_name_form = DisplayNameForm()

    if change_password_form.validate_on_submit():
        old_password = change_password_form.old_password.data
        new_password = change_password_form.new_password.data

        if bcrypt.check_password_hash(user.password_hash, old_password):
            user.password_hash = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(new_password).decode(
                "utf-8"
            )
            db.session.commit()
            flash("👍 Password successfully changed.")
            return redirect(url_for("settings"))
        else:
            flash("⛔️ Incorrect old password.")

    return render_template(
        "settings.html",
        change_password_form=change_password_form,
        change_username_form=change_username_form,
        smtp_settings_form=smtp_settings_form,
        pgp_key_form=pgp_key_form,
        display_name_form=display_name_form,
        user=user,
    )
```

## 35. Implementing the Change Username Functionality

This part of the code allows users to change their username. It's an important feature for personalization and user identity management within Hush Line.

1. Defining the Change Username Route:
- `@app.route("/change-username", methods=["POST"])`: This sets up the /change-username route to handle POST requests. Using POST is appropriate for this action because changing a username involves updating user data on the server.

2. User Authentication Check:
- The function starts by ensuring that a user is logged in by checking for `user_id` in the session. If the `user_id` is not found, the user is redirected to the login page.

3.Processing the Username Change Request:
- The user's details are retrieved from the database using their `user_id`.
- `new_username = request.form["new_username"]`: This line fetches the new username submitted by the user through the form.
- The application checks if the new username is already taken by another user (User.query.filter_by(username=new_username).first()).
- If the username is not taken (not existing_user):
    - The user's username is updated in the database.
    - The `username` in the session is also updated to reflect this change.
    - A success message is flashed to the user.
- If the new username is already taken, a message is flashed indicating that the user needs to choose a different username.

4. Redirecting to the Settings Page:
- `return redirect(url_for("settings"))`: After processing the request (regardless of whether the username was successfully changed or not), the user is redirected back to the settings page. This allows them to see the result of their action or to try a different username if needed.

In summary, the `/change-username` route provides users with the ability to change their username, enhancing the customization and flexibility of user accounts. This feature is especially useful for users who want to update their online identity or correct a username mistake. The route ensures that the username change process is secure, checking for authentication and verifying the uniqueness of the new username.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/change-username", methods=["POST"])
def change_username():
    user_id = session.get("user_id")
    if not user_id:
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = db.session.get(User, user_id)
    new_username = request.form["new_username"]
    existing_user = User.query.filter_by(username=new_username).first()

    if not existing_user:
        user.username = new_username
        db.session.commit()
        session["username"] = new_username  # Update username in session
        flash("👍 Username successfully changed.")
    else:
        flash("💔 This username is already taken.")

    return redirect(url_for("settings"))
```

## 36. Implementing the Logout Functionality

This section of the code defines the logout process for users in Hush Line. Logging out is a crucial feature that helps maintain security by ending a user's session and preventing unauthorized access, especially in shared or public environments.

1. Defining the Logout Route:
- `@app.route("/logout")`: This sets up the route `/logout` to handle user logout requests. When a user navigates to this URL, the function below is executed.

2. Clearing the User Session:
- `session.pop("user_id", None)`: This line removes the `user_id` from the session. Removing `user_id` effectively logs the user out, as their session no longer has the information that identifies them as a logged-in user.
- `session.pop("2fa_verified", None)`: Similarly, this line clears the `2fa_verified` flag from the session. It's important to reset this flag so that the next time the user logs in, they will have to pass through 2FA verification again, if required.

3. Redirecting to the Home Page:
- `return redirect(url_for("index"))`: After clearing the session data, the user is redirected to the home page (or index route) of Hush Line. This marks the completion of the logout process and takes the user back to the starting point of Hush Line, typically the login or welcome page.

In summary, the `/logout` route provides a secure and effective way for users to end their sessions. It ensures that all relevant session data is cleared, safeguarding against potential security risks that might occur if a session remains active after the user has left the application. This is a standard and essential feature in web applications, contributing to the overall security and user experience.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/logout")
def logout():
    session.pop("user_id", None)
    session.pop("2fa_verified", None)  # Clear 2FA verification flag
    return redirect(url_for("index"))
```

## 37. Extracting Email from PGP Key Functionality

The function `get_email_from_pgp_key` is set up to extract an email address from a provided PGP key, which is a common requirement in systems that use PGP encryption for secure communication. Here's a detailed explanation of how the function works:

1. Importing the PGP Key:
- Initially, the function tries to import the PGP key using `gpg.import_keys(pgp_key)`. This is crucial because you need to work with the key in the GPG environment of Hush Line.

2. Checking the Import Success:
- The function then checks if the key import was successful by verifying if any keys were actually imported `(imported_key.count > 0`).

3. Extracting the Key ID:
- If the import is successful, the function extracts the Key ID from the imported key. This ID is usually the last 16 characters of the key's fingerprint, a unique identifier for a PGP key.

4. Finding the Matching Key in the Keyring:
- The function lists all keys stored in the GPG keyring (`gpg.list_keys()`) and searches for the key that matches the imported key's ID.

5. Extracting the Email Address:
- Upon finding the matching key, the function looks for the email address in the key's user IDs (`uids`). The email address in PGP keys is typically enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`). The function locates these brackets and extracts the email address.

6. Error Handling and Logging:
- The entire process is wrapped in a try-except block to gracefully handle any exceptions, such as issues with the PGP key format. If an exception occurs, it's logged using `app.logger.error`, which helps in debugging and maintaining logs for the application.

7. Returning the Result:
- If an email address is successfully extracted, it is returned by the function.
- If the function fails to find an email address (or if an error occurs), it returns `None,` indicating the absence of a valid email in the provided PGP key.

This function is a useful utility for applications that need to associate PGP keys with specific user accounts or utilize the email address within a PGP key for communication purposes. It demonstrates careful error handling and logging, which are best practices in application development.

### Code Snippet

```
def get_email_from_pgp_key(pgp_key):
    try:
        # Import the PGP key
        imported_key = gpg.import_keys(pgp_key)

        if imported_key.count > 0:
            # Get the Key ID of the imported key
            key_id = imported_key.results[0]["fingerprint"][-16:]

            # List all keys to find the matching key
            all_keys = gpg.list_keys()
            for key in all_keys:
                if key["keyid"] == key_id:
                    # Extract email from the uid (user ID)
                    uids = key["uids"][0]
                    email_start = uids.find("<") + 1
                    email_end = uids.find(">")
                    if email_start > 0 and email_end > email_start:
                        return uids[email_start:email_end]
    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.error(f"Error extracting email from PGP key: {e}")

    return None
```

## 38. Implementing the Message Submission Route with Email Notification

This part of the code handles the functionality for users to submit messages through Hush Line, optionally using PGP encryption and email notifications. It's a feature that allows for secure and confidential communication within Hush Line.

1. Defining the Message Submission Route:
- `@app.route("/submit_message/<username>", methods=["GET", "POST"])`: This sets up a dynamic route for message submission. The `<username>` part in the URL is a variable, allowing the route to handle submissions to different users.

2. Preparing the Message Submission Form:
- `form = MessageForm()`: An instance of MessageForm is created for message input.
- The target user (the recipient of the message) is fetched from the database based on the provided username. If no such user is found, a flash message is shown, and the user is redirected to the home page.

3. Handling the Form Submission:
- If the form is validly submitted (form.validate_on_submit()):
    - The entered message content is retrieved.
    - If the target user has a PGP key, the message is encrypted using that key. If encryption fails or the email cannot be extracted from the PGP key, appropriate flash messages are displayed, and the user is redirected back to the form.
    - If the user doesn't have a PGP key, or encryption isn't required, the message is stored as-is.
    - The message, whether encrypted or not, is then saved to the database.

4. Sending Email Notifications:
- If the target user has SMTP settings configured, an email notification containing the message (encrypted if applicable) is sent to the user.
- The success or failure of the email sending process is indicated by a flash message.

5. Rendering the Form for Message Submission:
- If the form has not been submitted or if the submission process is not complete, the `submit_message.html` template is rendered.
- The template includes the message form, the target username, and the current user's ID, which can be useful for access control or displaying user-specific information.

In summary, the `/submit_message/<username>` route offers a comprehensive system for users to submit messages to each other. This system includes optional PGP encryption for added security and SMTP-based email notifications for communication efficiency. The implementation takes into account various scenarios, ensuring that the process is secure, user-friendly, and adaptable to different user configurations.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/submit_message/<username>", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def submit_message(username):
    form = MessageForm()
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()

    if not user:
        flash("🫥 User not found")
        return redirect(url_for("index"))

    # Debug: Print user IDs
    current_user_id = session.get("user_id")
    print("Current User ID:", current_user_id)
    print("Tip Line Owner User ID:", user.id)

    if form.validate_on_submit():
        content = form.content.data  # Sanitized input
        email_content = content  # Default to original content
        email_sent = False  # Flag to track email sending status

        if user.pgp_key:
            pgp_email = get_email_from_pgp_key(user.pgp_key)
            if pgp_email:
                encrypted_content = encrypt_message(content, pgp_email)
                if encrypted_content:
                    message = Message(content=encrypted_content, user_id=user.id)
                    email_content = encrypted_content  # Use encrypted content for email
                else:
                    flash("⛔️ Failed to encrypt message with PGP key.")
                    return redirect(url_for("submit_message", username=username))
            else:
                flash("⛔️ Unable to extract email from PGP key.")
                return redirect(url_for("submit_message", username=username))
        else:
            message = Message(content=content, user_id=user.id)

        db.session.add(message)
        db.session.commit()

        if (
            user.email
            and user.smtp_server
            and user.smtp_port
            and user.smtp_username
            and user.smtp_password
        ):
            email_sent = send_email(user.email, "New Message", email_content, user)

        if email_sent:
            flash("📥 Message submitted and emailed")
        else:
            flash("📥 Message submitted")

        return redirect(url_for("submit_message", username=username))

    current_user_id = session.get("user_id")
    return render_template(
        "submit_message.html",
        form=form,
        username=username,
        user=user,
        current_user_id=current_user_id,
    )
```

## 39. Email Sending Function for Notifications and Communications

The `send_email` function is designed to handle the sending of email notifications or messages from Hush Line. This function is particularly useful for informing users about various events or interactions within the app, such as receiving new messages.

1. Preparing the Email Message:
- `msg = MIMEMultipart()`: A new email message is created using the `MIMEMultipart` class. This format allows for more complex email structures, like adding attachments or HTML content, if needed.
- The `From`, `To`, and `Subject` headers are set up using the provided parameters and the user's email.
        The body of the email is attached as plain text (`MIMEText(body, "plain")`).

2. SMTP Server Configuration and Connection:
- The function logs the SMTP settings for debugging purposes, including the server, port, and username.
- It then attempts to connect to the SMTP server using `smtplib.SMTP`.
- `server.starttls()`: This initiates TLS (Transport Layer Security) for the connection, which encrypts the email contents for security during transmission.

3. Sending the Email:
- The function logs in to the SMTP server using the provided username and password.
- The email is converted to a string format and sent using `server.sendmail`.
- If the email is sent successfully, a confirmation is logged, and the function returns `True`.

4. Error Handling and Logging:
- If an exception occurs at any point during the email sending process, it is caught, logged with an error message and stack trace, and the function returns `False`. This error logging is helpful for troubleshooting issues related to email sending.

5. Function Return Value:
- The function returns a boolean value indicating the success (`True`) or failure (`False`) of the email sending process. This return value can be used to inform the user or trigger subsequent actions in Hush Line.

In summary, the `send_email` function is a crucial component for communication in Hush Line. It provides a reliable way to send emails, ensuring secure and encrypted transmission, and includes comprehensive error handling and logging for effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Code Snippet

```
def send_email(recipient, subject, body, user):
    app.logger.debug(
        f"SMTP settings being used: Server: {user.smtp_server}, Port: {user.smtp_port}, Username: {user.smtp_username}"
    )
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg["From"] = user.email
    msg["To"] = recipient
    msg["Subject"] = subject
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, "plain"))

    try:
        app.logger.debug("Attempting to connect to SMTP server")
        with smtplib.SMTP(user.smtp_server, user.smtp_port) as server:
            app.logger.debug("Starting TLS")
            server.starttls()

            app.logger.debug("Attempting to log in to SMTP server")
            server.login(user.smtp_username, user.smtp_password)

            app.logger.debug("Sending email")
            text = msg.as_string()
            server.sendmail(user.email, recipient, text)
            app.logger.info("Email sent successfully.")
            return True
    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.error(f"Error sending email: {e}", exc_info=True)
        return False
```

## 40. Validating PGP Key Functionality

The `is_valid_pgp_key` function is designed to validate a PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key within Hush Line. This function is essential for ensuring that users provide a valid and importable PGP key, which is crucial for secure communications or encryption-related features.

1. Logging the Key Import Attempt:
- `app.logger.debug(f"Attempting to import key: {key}")`: Before attempting to import the key, the function logs this action for debugging purposes. Logging the attempt helps track the function's operation and aids in troubleshooting if issues arise.

2. Trying to Import the PGP Key:
- `imported_key = gpg.import_keys(key)`: The function uses the `import_keys` method of the `gnupg.GPG` instance to try importing the provided PGP key. This is a crucial step to verify that the key is in a format that Hush Line's GPG installation recognizes and can work with.
- `app.logger.info(f"Key import attempt`: {imported_key.results}")`: After attempting the import, the function logs the results. This information is valuable for understanding how the GPG system is handling the key.

3. Determining the Validity of the Key:
- The function checks if the key has been successfully imported by examining `imported_key.count`. If the count is greater than 0, it means at least one key was successfully imported, indicating a valid PGP key.
- The function returns `True` if the key is valid (successfully imported) and `False` otherwise.

4. Error Handling and Logging:
- The import attempt is wrapped in a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the process, such as issues with the key format.
- If an exception is encountered, it is logged with `app.logger.error`, providing details of the error. The function then returns `False`, indicating the key is invalid.

5. Function Return Value:
- The return value of the function (`True` or `False`) indicates whether the provided PGP key is valid and importable. This boolean result can be used in Hush Line to confirm key validity before proceeding with further operations involving the PGP key.

In summary, the `is_valid_pgp_key` function plays a vital role in ensuring the integrity and usability of PGP keys provided by users. It verifies the importability of keys and handles errors gracefully, providing essential feedback for both application logging and user interaction.

### Code Snippet

```
def is_valid_pgp_key(key):
    app.logger.debug(f"Attempting to import key: {key}")
    try:
        imported_key = gpg.import_keys(key)
        app.logger.info(f"Key import attempt: {imported_key.results}")
        return imported_key.count > 0
    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.error(f"Error importing PGP key: {e}")
        return False
```

## 41. Implementing the Update PGP Key Route

This section of the code provides functionality for users to update their PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key in Hush Line. This feature is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of encrypted communications or data within Hush Line.

1. Defining the Update PGP Key Route:
- `@app.route("/update_pgp_key", methods=["GET", "POST"])`: This sets up the `/update_pgp_key` route to handle both GET and POST requests. The GET request displays the form for updating the PGP key, while the POST request processes the submitted key.

2. User Authentication Check:
- The function starts by verifying if the user is logged in, checking for `user_id` in the session. If not logged in, it redirects to the login page.

3. Processing PGP Key Update Requests:
- A `PGPKeyForm` instance is created to manage the PGP key input from the user.
- `if form.validate_on_submit()`: This checks if the form has been submitted and the input is valid.
    - If the input field is empty (`pgp_key.strip() == ""`), the user's PGP key is set to `None`, effectively removing it.
    - If a key is provided, the `is_valid_pgp_key` function checks its validity. If the key is valid, it's updated in the user's record.
    - If the key is invalid, a flash message indicates the issue, and the user is redirected to the settings page to try again.

4. Committing Changes and Redirecting:
- After successfully updating or removing the PGP key, the changes are committed to the database.
- A success message is flashed, and the user is redirected back to the settings page.

5. Rendering the Update PGP Key Form:
- If the form has not been submitted or an error occurs, the settings page with the PGP key update form (`PGPKeyForm`) is rendered. This allows the user to enter or update their PGP key.

In summary, the `/update_pgp_key` route allows users to conveniently add, update, or remove their PGP key associated with their account. This feature enhances the security and flexibility of user accounts, especially for applications that involve secure communication or data encryption. The route ensures the validity of the PGP key and provides clear user feedback for each action taken.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/update_pgp_key", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def update_pgp_key():
    user_id = session.get("user_id")
    if not user_id:
        flash("⛔️ User not authenticated.")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = db.session.get(User, user_id)
    form = PGPKeyForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        pgp_key = form.pgp_key.data

        if pgp_key.strip() == "":
            # If the field is empty, remove the PGP key
            user.pgp_key = None
        elif is_valid_pgp_key(pgp_key):
            # If the field is not empty and the key is valid, update the PGP key
            user.pgp_key = pgp_key
        else:
            # If the PGP key is invalid
            flash("⛔️ Invalid PGP key format or import failed.")
            return redirect(url_for("settings"))

        db.session.commit()
        flash("👍 PGP key updated successfully.")
        return redirect(url_for("settings"))
    return render_template("settings.html", form=form)
```

## 42. Message Encryption Function Using PGP

The `encrypt_message` function is designed to encrypt messages using PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), targeting a specific recipient's email. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where secure and private communication is necessary.

1. Initializing GPG for Encryption:
- `gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome=gpg_home, options=["--trust-model", "always"])`: This line initializes a GPG object for encryption, specifying the GPG home directory and setting the trust model to always trust the keys. This is important for ensuring that the GPG environment is correctly set up for encryption.

2. Logging the Encryption Attempt:
- `app.logger.info(f"Encrypting message for recipient: {recipient_email}")`: Before attempting encryption, the function logs the action. This is useful for tracking and debugging purposes.

3. Performing the Encryption:
- `encrypted_data = gpg.encrypt(message, recipients=recipient_email, always_trust=True)`: The function attempts to encrypt the provided `message` for the `recipient_email`. The `always_trust=True` parameter is used to bypass the trust check, which is often necessary in automated systems.

4. Handling Encryption Success or Failure:
- The function checks if the encryption was successful (`encrypted_data.ok`).
- If successful, the encrypted message is returned as a string (`str(encrypted_data)`). This string can then be used or stored as needed in Hush Line.
- If the encryption fails, an error is logged with the failure status (`app.logger.error(f"Encryption failed: {encrypted_data.status}")`), and `None` is returned. This allows Hush Line to handle encryption failures gracefully.

5. Function Return Value:
- The function returns the encrypted message as a string if successful, or `None` if the encryption process fails. This return behavior is useful for conditional processing in Hush Line, depending on whether the encryption was successful.

In summary, the `encrypt_message` function provides a secure way to encrypt messages using PGP, tailored for specific recipients. By logging actions and handling potential failures, the function ensures robustness and reliability, key aspects for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of communications within Hush Line.

### Code Snippet

```
def encrypt_message(message, recipient_email):
    gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome=gpg_home, options=["--trust-model", "always"])
    app.logger.info(f"Encrypting message for recipient: {recipient_email}")

    encrypted_data = gpg.encrypt(message, recipients=recipient_email, always_trust=True)

    if not encrypted_data.ok:
        app.logger.error(f"Encryption failed: {encrypted_data.status}")
        return None

    return str(encrypted_data)
```

## 43. Listing PGP Keys Function

The `list_keys` function is designed to list all the PGP public keys currently stored in the application's GPG keyring. This function is particularly useful for administrative purposes, such as verifying key imports or troubleshooting issues related to key management.

1. Function for Listing Public Keys:
- `def list_keys()`: The function is defined to execute the process of listing all PGP public keys.

2. Executing the Key Listing Process:
- Inside a try-except block, the function calls `gpg.list_keys()` to retrieve a list of all public keys stored in the GPG keyring.

3. Logging Key Information:
- The function logs a message indicating the start of the key listing process.
- It iterates through the retrieved list of keys, logging each key's details. This information is valuable for understanding which keys are available in the keyring, and it can be helpful for debugging or administrative review.

4. Error Handling:
- If an exception occurs during the key listing process, such as an issue with the GPG configuration or an operational error, it is caught and logged. This helps in identifying and resolving potential issues with the GPG setup or key management.

5. Function Invocation:
- After defining the function, it's immediately called (`list_keys()`). This means the function will list the keys as soon as this code is executed. Depending on Hush Line's requirements, you might want to call this function under specific conditions, like after key import operations or during certain troubleshooting scenarios.

In summary, the `list_keys` function serves as a diagnostic tool to view and log the public PGP keys in Hush Line's GPG keyring. By providing a clear view of the keys present, it aids in managing key-related functionalities and troubleshooting potential issues related to PGP encryption and decryption processes.

### Code Snippet

```
def list_keys():
    try:
        public_keys = gpg.list_keys()
        app.logger.info("Public keys in the keyring:")
        for key in public_keys:
            app.logger.info(f"Key: {key}")
    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.error(f"Error listing keys: {e}")


# Call this function after key import or during troubleshooting
list_keys()
```

## 44. Implementing the Update SMTP Settings Route

This section of the code defines a route for users to update their SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) settings. SMTP settings are crucial for enabling the application to send emails on behalf of the user.

1. Defining the Update SMTP Settings Route:
- `@app.route("/update_smtp_settings", methods=["GET", "POST"])`: This sets up the route to handle both GET and POST requests. The GET request is for displaying the form with current SMTP settings, and the POST request is for submitting updated settings.

2. User Authentication and Retrieval:
- The function begins by verifying if a user is logged in. If not, it redirects to the login page.
- The user's details are retrieved from the database using their `user_id` from the session. If the user is not found, a flash message is displayed, and the user is redirected to the settings page.

3. Initializing Forms:
- Instances of various forms are created, including `SMTPSettingsForm`, which is specifically used for updating SMTP settings. Other forms like `ChangePasswordForm`, `ChangeUsernameForm`, and `PGPKeyForm` are also initialized, as they might be part of the `settings.html` template.

4. Processing SMTP Settings Form Submission:
- If the `SMTPSettingsForm` is submitted and validated (`smtp_settings_form.validate_on_submit()`):
    - The user's SMTP settings (email, server, port, username, and password) are updated with the data from the form.
    - The updated information is committed to the database.
    - A success message is flashed, and the user is redirected back to the settings page.

5. Prepopulating Form Fields:
- SMTP settings fields in the form are prepopulated with the user's current settings for convenience. Note that the password field is typically not prepopulated for security reasons.

6. Rendering the Settings Page:
- `return render_template(...)`: The settings page is rendered with all the forms, including the prepopulated SMTP settings form. This allows the user to view and update their SMTP settings.

In summary, the `/update_smtp_settings` route provides a user-friendly interface for updating SMTP settings, ensuring that users can configure their email sending capabilities within the application. It includes validation of the input data, secure handling of sensitive information like passwords, and clear feedback to the user upon successful update.


### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/update_smtp_settings", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def update_smtp_settings():
    user_id = session.get("user_id")
    if not user_id:
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = db.session.get(User, user_id)
    if not user:
        flash("⛔️ User not found")
        return redirect(url_for("settings"))

    # Initialize forms
    change_password_form = ChangePasswordForm()
    change_username_form = ChangeUsernameForm()
    smtp_settings_form = SMTPSettingsForm()
    pgp_key_form = PGPKeyForm()

    # Handling SMTP settings form submission
    if smtp_settings_form.validate_on_submit():
        # Updating SMTP settings from form data
        user.email = smtp_settings_form.email.data
        user.smtp_server = smtp_settings_form.smtp_server.data
        user.smtp_port = smtp_settings_form.smtp_port.data
        user.smtp_username = smtp_settings_form.smtp_username.data
        user.smtp_password = smtp_settings_form.smtp_password.data

        db.session.commit()
        flash("👍 SMTP settings updated successfully")
        return redirect(url_for("settings"))

    # Prepopulate SMTP settings form fields
    smtp_settings_form.email.data = user.email
    smtp_settings_form.smtp_server.data = user.smtp_server
    smtp_settings_form.smtp_port.data = user.smtp_port
    smtp_settings_form.smtp_username.data = user.smtp_username
    # Note: Password fields are typically not prepopulated for security reasons

    pgp_key_form.pgp_key.data = user.pgp_key

    return render_template(
        "settings.html",
        user=user,
        smtp_settings_form=smtp_settings_form,
        change_password_form=change_password_form,
        change_username_form=change_username_form,
        pgp_key_form=pgp_key_form,
    )
```

## 45. Implementing the Message Deletion Route

This part of the code defines the functionality for deleting messages in Hush Line. It ensures that only authenticated users can delete their own messages, maintaining data integrity and privacy.

1. Defining the Message Deletion Route:
- `@app.route("/delete_message/<int:message_id>", methods=["POST"])`: This sets up the route for deleting a message. The `<int:message_id>` in the URL captures the unique identifier of the message to be deleted. The route is restricted to POST requests, as it involves changing data on the server.

2. User Authentication Check:
- The function starts by checking if the user is logged in (`"user_id" not in session`). If not, the user is prompted to log in and redirected to the login page.

3. User and Message Verification:
- The user's details are fetched from the database using the `user_id` stored in the session.
- The message with the given `message_id` is retrieved from the database.
- The function then checks if the message exists and whether it belongs to the logged-in user (`message.user_id == user.id`). This is crucial to prevent users from deleting messages that don't belong to them.

4. Deleting the Message:
- If the message exists and belongs to the user, it is deleted from the database, and the deletion is committed (`db.session.commit()`).
- A success message is flashed to inform the user that the message has been deleted.

5. Handling Unauthorized or Non-existent Messages:
- If the message doesn't exist or doesn't belong to the logged-in user, a flash message indicates either the message was not found or the user is unauthorized to delete it.

6. Redirecting to the Inbox:
- After handling the deletion (or if the deletion isn't possible), the user is redirected back to their inbox. This is done using `redirect(url_for("inbox", username=user.username))`.

In summary, the `/delete_message/<int:message_id>` route provides a secure way for users to delete their messages. It ensures that only authenticated users can delete messages, and only those messages that belong to them, thereby maintaining the privacy and security of user data within the application.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/delete_message/<int:message_id>", methods=["POST"])
def delete_message(message_id):
    if "user_id" not in session:
        flash("🔑 Please log in to continue.")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = User.query.get(session["user_id"])
    if not user:
        flash("🫥 User not found. Please log in again.")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    message = Message.query.get(message_id)
    if message and message.user_id == user.id:
        db.session.delete(message)
        db.session.commit()
        flash("🗑️ Message deleted successfully.")
    else:
        flash("⛔️ Message not found or unauthorized access.")

    return redirect(url_for("inbox", username=user.username))
```

## 46. Implementing Account Deletion with Enhanced Security

This section of the code is crucial for allowing users to delete their accounts. It's an important feature that respects user autonomy and privacy. The inclusion of the `@require_2fa decorator` adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that this sensitive action is thoroughly authenticated.

1. Defining the Account Deletion Route with 2FA Check:
- `@app.route("/delete-account", methods=["POST"])`: This route is set up to handle POST requests for account deletion. POST is used because this action changes critical data on the server.
- `@require_2fa`: This decorator ensures that the account deletion functionality is only accessible to users who have passed two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized account deletions.

2. User Authentication Check:
- The function checks if the user is logged in by verifying the presence of `user_id` in the session. If not, the user is asked to log in and redirected to the login page.

3. User Existence Verification and Account Deletion:
- The user's details are fetched from the database using the `user_id`.
- If the user exists, the function proceeds to delete the user's account and all related records from the database (`db.session.delete(user)`). This action is irreversible and removes all user data from the system.
- The database changes are committed to ensure that the account deletion is finalized.

4. Session Clearance and User Logout:
- After deleting the account, the user's session is cleared (`session.clear()`), effectively logging them out. This step is crucial as it removes any session data that was associated with the deleted account.
- A message is flashed to confirm the account deletion.

5. Redirecting to the Home Page:
- The user is then redirected to the home page of the application (`redirect(url_for("index"))`). This is the standard procedure after account deletion, as the user no longer has access to any account-specific areas of the application.

6. Handling Non-existent User Accounts:
- If the user is not found in the database (possibly due to an invalid session), a relevant message is flashed, and the user is redirected to log in again.

In summary, the `/delete-account` route offers users the ability to delete their accounts securely. By requiring two-factor authentication and ensuring that only authenticated users can delete their accounts, the route upholds high security and privacy standards. This feature is vital in applications that store personal or sensitive user data, as it gives users control over their information and complies with privacy best practices.

### Code Snippet

```
@app.route("/delete-account", methods=["POST"])
@require_2fa
def delete_account():
    user_id = session.get("user_id")
    if not user_id:
        flash("🔑 Please log in to continue.")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    if user:
        # Delete user and related records
        db.session.delete(user)
        db.session.commit()

        # Clear session and log out
        session.clear()
        flash("👋 Your account has been deleted.")
        return redirect(url_for("index"))
    else:
        flash("🫥 User not found. Please log in again.")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))
```

## 47. Starting the Flask Application with Database Initialization

This section of the code is the entry point for running Hush Line. It includes crucial steps for initializing the database and starting the web server.

1. Conditional Execution Check:
- `if __name__ == "__main__"`: This line checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module). This is a common pattern in Python scripts to ensure that certain code only runs when the script is executed directly.

2. Database Initialization within App Context:
- `with app.app_context()`: This ensures that the following code block runs within the context of Hush Line. This is necessary for operations like database initialization that might require access to Hush Line's configuration and context.
- `db.create_all()`: This line initializes the database by creating all the tables defined in the SQLAlchemy models. It's a crucial step for setting up Hush Line's database schema before the app starts running.

3. Starting the Flask Application:
- `app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)`: This line runs the Flask application.
    - `debug=True` enables the debug mode, which provides a helpful debugger on the browser and auto-reloads the server upon code changes. This is beneficial during development but should be turned off in a production environment for security reasons.
   - `host="0.0.0.0"` sets the host to `0.0.0.0`, which makes Hush Line accessible from external machines, not just localhost. This can be useful for testing on different devices but should be carefully considered in a production environment for security.
    - `port=5000` specifies that the application will run on port 5000. You can change this port number based on Hush Line's requirements or environment settings.

In summary, this part of the code is responsible for the initial setup and running of Hush Line. It ensures the database is initialized correctly and starts the web server, making Hush Line accessible to users. The use of the development settings like debug mode and a globally accessible host is suitable for testing and development phases but should be adapted for secure and efficient production deployment.

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
    app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```
