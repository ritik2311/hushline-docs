# Getting Started

The hosted version of Hush Line is the first free and open-source anonymous tip-line-as-a-service, and the easiest way to get started. It's as simple as signing up, and you'll have a way for anyone to send you a private message. It's for those needing one or more tip lines without worrying about managing and maintaining their infrastructure.
