[Hush Line](https://hushline.app/) is a lightweight, secure, and anonymous tip line. It's easy to install and to use.

Think of a box in your office or school in which people can slip in anonymous messages, with a lock on it that only you have the key to open.

It's intended for journalists and newsrooms to offer a public tip line, by educators and school administrators to provide students with a safe way to report potentially sensitive information, or employers for anonymous employee reporting.

This guide will show you to set up your own Hush Line.
