# Paid Features

Large organizations might need features aimed at scale, making it easier to manage multiple tip lines. These users have the option to subscribe to a paid tier of service that allows for the creation of up to five additional usernames, making juggling multiple stories, campaigns, or initiatives at once easy.

## Customer Support

In addition to expanded usernames, paid users get human customer support with fast response times and even faster resolution to your issues.
