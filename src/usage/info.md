# Information Page

Hush Line deploys with an information page that provides the sender with additional information that might be helpful before submitting a message.

## When to use Hush Line

We've leaned on the guidance from [Whistleblower.org](https://whistleblower.org) and included some information from their resources for when to use a tip line. They include when you have evidence of wrongdoing, including:

- a violation of law, rule, or regulation,
- gross mismanagement,
- a gross waste of funds,
- abuse of authority, or
- a substantial danger to public health or safety.

## Hush Line addresses

If you deployed to a public domain, you'll find both your onion address and public website listed here. 

## Share it!

This is a great page to print out and place where it's easily discoverable. If you're using Hush Line for a school or workplace, you can print it, place it in common areas, copy the info, and email it broadly. If you're a journalist, this can be the page you share publicly so people using your Hush Line have more context before sending a message.  

## Verify your address!

Before you trust any link, whether an onion domain or a public website, you should verify its address. We encourage Hush Line operators to post their address in at least three different locations - social media, website, and email signature, for example - so individuals sending a message can verify they have the correct address before visiting and sharing potentially sensitive information.
