# Reading Messages

When someone sends you a Hush Line message, it'll get delivered to the email account you configured during installation. Messages will have the subject line "ðŸ¤« New Hush Line Message Received."

## Gmail + Mailvelope

When you click on your Hush Line message you might be prompted to enter your Mailvelope password. Recall that this is the password we set up in our prerequisites.
