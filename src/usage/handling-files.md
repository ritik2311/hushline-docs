# Handling Files

You automatically open yourself up to significant risks when you download files. To help protect yourself better, always follow these rules:

1. Provide instructions for users to first zip, then encrypt their files with your public PGP key.
2. When you download the files, save them to an external USB drive, and never your hard drive.
3. Use a dedicated, offline-only (air-gapped) computer to open the files. 
4. Never open the files on your own computer.
