# Handling Files

You automatically open yourself up to significant risks when you download files. To help protect yourself better, always follow these rules:

1. Instruct users to zip, then encrypt their files with your public PGP key.
2. When you download the files, save them to an external USB drive, never your hard drive.
3. Open the files with a dedicated, offline-only (air-gapped) computer. 
4. Never open the files on your personal or work computers.
