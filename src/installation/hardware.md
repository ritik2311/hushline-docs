# Required Hardware 

We're going to "run" Hush Line on a small, cheap computer called a Raspberry Pi. We recommend Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. Here are the Amazon links to the things we'll need:

- One [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TC2BK1X/ref=ox_sc_act_title_4?smid=A1JX327N91FZPX&th=1)
- One [Raspberry Pi 4 power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TYQRXTK/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?smid=A30ZYR2W3VAJ0A&psc=1)
- A [MicroSD card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073JYC4XM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?smid=A2TWIRHLRS9O1T&psc=1), which will serve as the Raspberry Pi's hard drive.
- A MicroSD card **reader** will be needed for initial set up. You might have one already, but if not [here's one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MobileMate-microSD-Card-Reader/dp/B07G5JV2B5/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=SanDisk-MobileMate-microSD-Card-Reader&qid=1695826928&sr=8-3).

Once you've rounded all that up, it's time to set up your Raspberry Pi.
