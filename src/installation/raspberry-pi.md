# Setting up your Raspberry Pi

If you didn't know, your Raspberry Pi doesn't come with an operating system. Don't panic! We're going to install one now called Raspberry Pi OS.

The way this works is we're going to put Raspberry Pi OS onto your microSD card. To do this, you need a program called Raspberry Pi Imager and a computer (not your Raspberry Pi).

1. On a computer, [download Raspberry Pi Imager here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and install it.
2. Insert your MicroSD card into your computer.
3. Start the Raspberry Pi Imager program.
4. In the Imager program, click "CHOOSE OS". We want "Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)" (it may be under "Raspberry Pi OS (other)".
5. Click "CHOOSE STORAGE" and select your MicroSD card.
6. Click the gear button in the bottom-right of the window. Enter your wi-fi network information. Also, choose to "Enable SSH" and create a strong password for your Raspberry Pi. Save this password some safe. e.g. by writing it down or in a password manager.
7. Click the "WRITE" button and wait a moment. This will "write" Raspberry Pi OS to your MicroSD card.

## Starting up your Raspberry Pi for the first time

Now we're ready to turn on our Raspberry Pi. 

1. Eject your microSD from your computer. Place it in to the Raspberry Pi.
2. Plug your Raspberry Pi into a computer monitor, using a Micro HDMI cable.
3. Plug a keyboard into your Raspberry Pi.
4. Plug your Raspberry Pi power supply into your Raspberry and into an outlet.

Your Raspberry Pi should turn on once you plug it in. 

Next, we're going to set up an email address for Hush Line to use.
