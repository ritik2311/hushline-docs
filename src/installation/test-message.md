# Sending a test message using Hush Line

Now that Hush Line is set up, let's send a test message. 

1. In Tor Browser, visit your Hush Line site URL (it will look something like `http://vfalkrrucjb7pztjskfumnqytpze5iimu4i2t2ygwv6ntylvylt2flad.onion`). You should see your Hush Line form.
2. Enter a test message like "Here's a secret message!"
3. Click the submit button.
4. Open Apple Mail. In a moment you should receive an email with the subject line "ðŸ¤« New Hush Line Message Received". 
5. When you try to read the email, Apple Mail should prompt you to enter your Hush Line PGP password. Once that's entered, you should be able to read your test message.

Congratulations! Your Hush Line is now ready for regular, day-to-day use.
